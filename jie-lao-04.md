## 解老 Jie Lao 4 (_Laozi_ 60)

> 工人數變業
則失其功
If craftsmen repeatedly change their work,
they diminish their accomplishments;  
作者數搖徙
則亡其功
If workmen repeatedly change their occupations,
they lose their accomplishments.  
一人之作日亡半日
十日則亡五人之功矣
If one man loses half-a-day's productivity daily,
in ten days the productivity of five men will be lost.  
萬人之作日亡半日
十日則亡五萬人之功矣
If ten thousand men lose half-a-day's productivity daily,
in ten days the productivity of fifty thousand men will be lost.

然
則數變業者
其人彌眾
其虧彌大矣
Thus,
the more numerous are those who frequently change their work,
the greater are the losses that will be incurred.
凡
法令更
則利害易
As a general rule,
if laws and ordinances are altered,
what is advantageous and disadvantageous will likewise change.
利害易
則民務變
If what is advantageous and disadvantageous change,
the duties of the people will likewise change.
務變之謂變業
A change in the people's duties is known as a change in the people's work.
故
以理觀之
事大眾
而數搖之
則少成功
Therefore,
if you rely upon the ordering principles [of the Way] you will observe
that if tasks are weighty and numerous
and they are frequently shifted,
there will be few results.
藏大器
而數徙之
則多敗傷
If you store a large vessel
but frequently move it,
it will suffer numerous damages.
烹小鮮
而數撓之
則賊其澤
If you fry a small fish
but frequently disturb it,
you will ruin its flavor.
治大國
而數變法
則民苦之
Likewise, if you rule a large state
but frequently change the laws,
the people will suffer hardships because of it.
是以有道之君貴靜
不重變法
This is why the ruler who possesses the Way values emptiness and tranquility
and looks gravely upon changing the laws.
故曰
Thus it is said:
治大國者若烹小鮮
"*Ruling a large state is like frying a small fish.*"

> 人處疾
則貴醫
If people fall ill,
they prize physicians.  
有禍
則畏鬼
If people encounter disasters,
they fear ghosts.

聖人在上
則民少欲
If a sage occupies the throne,
the people will have few desires.
民少欲
則血氣治
If the people have few desires,
their blood and vital breath will be well regulated.
{If their blood and vital breath are regulated,
their movements and actions will be well ordered.
When blood and vital breath are well regulated}
而舉動理
則少禍害
and movements and actions are well ordered,
there will be few disasters and harms.
夫
內無痤疽癉痔之害
而外無刑罰法誅之禍者
其輕恬鬼也甚
Indeed,
those who are free from the troubles of boils and piles internally
and incur no disasters from penalties and punishments externally,
hold ghosts in deep contempt.
故曰
Thus it is said:
以道蒞天下
其鬼不神
"*When you use the Way to govern the world,
ghosts will have no numinous powers.*"

治世
之民不與鬼神相害也
In a well-governed state,
the people and ghostly spirits do not harm one another.
故曰
Thus it is said:
非其鬼不神也
其神不傷人也
"*It is not that ghosts are not spirits,
but the spirits do not harm the people.*"

> 鬼崇也疾人之
謂鬼傷人
When ghosts fall upon sick people,
it is said that ghosts harm people.  
人逐除之之
謂人傷鬼也
When people drive ghosts away,
it is said that people harm ghosts.  
民犯法令之
謂民傷上
When the people defy the laws and ordinances,
it is said that the people harm the ruler.  
上刑戮民之
謂上傷民
When the ruler punishes and chastises the people,
it is said that the ruler harms the people.

民不犯法
則上亦不行刑
If the people do not defy the laws,
the ruler will not have to apply the punishments.
上不行刑之
謂上不傷人
If the ruler has no need to apply the punishments,
it is said that the ruler does not harm the people.
故曰
Thus it is said:
聖人亦不傷民
"*The sage, also, will not harm the people.*"
上不與民相害
而人不與鬼相傷
There exists no mutual harm between the ruler and the people
or mutual injury between the people and ghosts.
故曰
Thus it is said:
兩不相傷
"*The two do not injure one another.*"

民不敢犯法
則上內不用刑罰
而外不事利其產業
If the people do not dare defy the laws,
the ruler will not employ punishments and penalties inside [his state],
while he will not strive to avail himself of goods and products [made] outside [his state].
上內不用刑罰
而外不事利其產業
則民蕃息
If the ruler does not employ punishments and penalties inside [his state]
and does not strive to avail himself of goods and products [made] outside [his state],
the people will flourish.
民蕃息
而畜積盛
If the people flourish,
their reserves will be plentiful.
民蕃息
而畜積盛
之謂有德
If the people flourish
and their reserves are plentiful,
they are said to "possess potency."
凡
所謂崇者
魂魄去
而精神亂
As a general rule,
those who are called "cursed"
are those who are bereft of *hun* and *po* souls
and whose quintessential spirit is disordered.
精神亂
則無德
If quintessential spirit is disordered,
they will have no potency.
鬼不崇人
則魂魄不去
If ghosts do not inflict curses upon people,
their hun and po souls will not leave [their bodies].
魂魄不去
而精神不亂
If their hun and po souls do not leave [their bodies],
their quintessential spirit will not be disordered.
精神不亂
之謂有德
If their quintessential spirit is not disordered,
they are said to "possess potency."
上盛畜積
而鬼不亂其精神
則德盡在於民矣
If the ruler abounds with reserves,
and the ghosts do not disorder his quintessential spirit,
potency will develop to its utmost among the people.
故曰
Thus it is said:
兩不相傷
則德交歸焉
"*Since the two do not harm one another,
their potency intermingles and returns home to them.*"

{言其德上下交盛
而俱歸於民也}
