## 解老 Jie Lao 8 (_Laozi_ 50)

> 人始於生
而卒於死
People begin in life
and end in death.
始之謂出
To begin is called "to come forth to."
卒之謂入
To end is called "to enter into."
故曰
Thus it is said:
出生入死
"*We come forth to life and enter into death.*"

人之身三百六十節
四肢
九竅
其大具也
The human body with its 360 joints,
four limbs
and nine apertures
is essentially equipped.
四肢與九竅十有三者
Four limbs plus nine apertures totals 13.
十有三者之動靜盡屬於生焉
The activity and quiescence of these 13 things are associated with life.
屬之謂徒也
To be associated with something is called "being a companion."
故曰
Thus it is said:
生之徒也十有三者
"The companions of life number thirteen."

至死也
十有三具者皆還而屬之於死
死之徒
亦有十三
When it comes to their death,
these 13 revert back to becoming associated with the realm of death
so that the companions of death
also [are governed by the] number 13.
故曰
Thus it is said:
生之徒十有三
死之徒十有三
"*The companions of life number thirteen.
The companions of death number thirteen.*"

凡
民之生生而生者
固動
As a general rule,
people who live regarding life as life,
certainly move.
動盡
則損也
而動不止
是損而不止也
Yet movement
ultimately leads to loss
and if movement does not cease,
losses do not cease.
損而不止
則生盡
When losses do not cease,
life is exhausted.
生盡之謂死
則十有三具者皆為死死地也
The exhausting of life is called "death"
so that the 13 all come to belong to the realm of death.
故曰
Thus it is said:
民之生生而動
動皆之死地
之十有三
"*And the people who cling to life as life and move,
whose every movement leads them to the realm of death,
also number thirteen.*"

是以聖人愛精神
而貴處靜
This is why the sage cherishes his quintessential spirit
and prizes dwelling in tranquility.
此甚大於兕虎之害
Otherwise the harm he would suffer would be greater than that inflicted by rhinos and tigers.
夫兕虎有域
動靜有時
Indeed rhinos and tigers have their definite habitats
and their periods of activity and quiescence.
避其域
省其時
則免其兕虎之害矣
Avoid their habitats
and calculate their periods of activity and quiescence
and you will evade the harm inflicted by rhinos and tigers.
民獨知兕虎之有爪角也
而莫知萬物之盡有爪角也
不免於萬物之害
However,
since people only know that rhinos and tigers possess horns and claws that inflict harm,
but do not know that everything in the world possesses their [figurative] "horns and claws,"
they are unable to evade the harm brought about by the myriad things of the world.
何以論之
How should this be discussed?
時雨降集
曠野閒靜
而以昏晨犯山川
則風露之爪角害之
When the seasonal rains fall and collect
and the wide fields are empty and still,
if you cross mountains or rivers at dawn or dusk,
"the horns and claws" of wind and dew will harm you.
事上不忠
輕犯
禁令
則刑法之爪角害之
When serving your superior,
if you fail to be loyal,
look lightly upon the prohibitions,
or disobey the ordinances,
then the "horns and claws" of punishments and laws will harm you.
處鄉
不節
憎愛無度
則爭鬥之爪角害之
When living in the village,
if you do not moderate your behavior,
hating and loving without measure,
then the "horns and claws" of fights and disputes will harm you.
嗜慾無限
動靜不節
則痤疽之爪角害之
When your appetites and desires know no limit,
and your activity and quiescence is not moderated,
the "horns and claws" of boils and piles will harm you.
好用其私智
而棄道理
則網羅之爪角害之
When you grow fond of following your personal opinions
and disregard the ordering principles of the Way,
the "horns and claws" of nets and traps will harm you.
兕虎有域
而萬害有原
Rhinos and tigers have their habitats
and the myriad harms of the world have their sources.
避其域
塞其原
則免於諸害矣
When you avoid their habitats
and block up their sources,
you will evade their various harms.

凡
兵革者
所以備害也
As a general rule,
weapons and armor
are the means by which you prepare against harm.
重生者
雖入軍無忿爭之心
Those who value life
will be free of angry and contentious hearts even if they enter the army.
無忿爭之心
則無所用救害之備
Being free of an angry and contentious heart,
they will have no use or desire to be prepared against harm.
此非獨謂野處之軍也
This is not only a reference to armies camped in the wilderness.
聖人之遊世也
無害人之心
When the sage wanders through the world,
he does not harbor a heart [that desires to] harm others.
無害人之心
則必無人害
Since he does not harbor a heart [that desires to] harm others,
he is invariably free from others' harm.
無人害
則不備人
Since he is invariably free from others' harm,
he need not prepare against others.
故曰
Thus it is said:
陸行
不遇兕虎
"*When walking in the hills,
he does not happen upon rhinos or tigers.*"
入山
不恃備以救害
When he enters the mountains,
he does not prepare himself against harm.
故曰
Thus it is said:
入軍
不備甲兵
"*When entering the army,
he does not prepare himself with armor or weapons.*"
遠諸害
He is removed from all things that cause harm.
故曰
Thus it is said:
兕無所投其角
虎無所錯其爪
兵無所容其刃
"*Rhinos have no place to butt their horns.
Tigers have no place to thrust their claws.
Weapons have no place to lay their blades.*"

不設備而必無害
天地之道理也
To invariably suffer no harm if you do not make preparations against harm
is an ordering principle of the Way [that is grounded in] Heaven and Earth.
體天地之道
故曰
Since he embodies the Way of Heaven and Earth,
it is said:
無死地焉
"*There is no realm of death in him.*"
動無死地
而謂之
善攝生矣
When he moves there is no realm of death for him
and so he is said to
"*excel at holding onto life.*"
