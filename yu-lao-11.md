## 喻老 Yu Lao 11 (_Laozi_ 33)

楚莊王欲伐越
杜子諫曰
King Zhuang of Chu wished to attack Yue
when Duzi admonished him, saying;
王之伐越何也
"Why does Your Highness wish to attack Yue?"
曰
[The king] replied:
政亂兵弱
"Its government is in disarray and its troops are weak."
杜子曰
Duzi responded:
臣愚患之
"Your humble servant is fearful of such a plan.
智如目也
Your Highness's wisdom is like the eyes;
能見百步之外
而不能自見其睫
they can see beyond 100 paces
but cannot see their eyelashes.
王之兵自敗於秦晉
喪地數百里
Since Your Highness's troops have been roundly defeated by the states of Qin and Jin,
Chu has lost a territory of several hundred li.
此兵之弱也
These are instances of weakened troops.
莊蹻為盜於境內
而吏不能禁
Zhuang Qiao haughtily engages in banditry within your borders
and your officials are unable to stop him.
此政之亂也
These are instances of governance in disarray.
王之弱亂非越之下也
而欲伐越
Thus the chaos and weakness of Your Highness is no less that of Yue,
yet Your Highness desires to attack Yue.
此智之如目也
This is a case of Your Highness's wisdom resembling the eyes."
王乃止
Upon hearing this, the king abandoned his plans.

故知之難
不在見人
在自見
Therefore the challenges of knowing
do not lie in understanding others,
they lie in understanding oneself.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
自見之謂明
"*Understanding oneself is called clarity.*"

子夏見曾子
曾子曰
When Zixia paid a visit to Zengzi [both famous disciples of Confucius],
Zengzi inquired:
何肥也
"Why have you become so plump?"
對曰
Zixia replied:
戰勝故肥也
"I have recently been victorious in battle."
曾子曰
Zixia responded:
何謂也
"Pray tell what do you mean?"
子夏曰
Zixia said:
吾入見先王之義
則榮之
出見富貴之樂
又榮之
"Whenever I retired to observe the righteous principles of the former kings
I reveled in it
but when I emerged to observe the pleasures of the wealthy and noble
I reveled in that too.
兩者戰於胸中
未知勝負
故臞
These two have waged a battle in my breast.
When I do not yet know which will be victorious
I grow lean.
今先王之義勝
故肥
Just now the righteous principles of the former kings have won out
so I have grown plump."

是以志之難也
不在勝人
在自勝也
Hence the challenges of the will
do not lie in conquering others
they lie in conquering oneself.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
自勝之謂強
"*Conquering oneself is called strength.*"
