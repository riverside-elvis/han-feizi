## 解老 Jie Lao 5 (_Laozi_ 46)

有道之君
外無怨讎於鄰敵
而內有德澤於人民
A ruler who possesses the Way
is free of enmity from his neighbors and rivals outside [his state]
and his beneficence saturates the people inside [his state].
夫外無怨讎於鄰敵者
其遇諸侯也外有禮義
Now a ruler who is free of enmity from his neighbors and rivals outside [his state]
is a ruler who comports himself with propriety and righteousness in receiving the Lords of the Land.
內有德澤於人民者
其治人事也務本
A ruler whose potency saturates the people inside [his state]
is a ruler who regulates the peoples' tasks by striving for the fundamentals.
遇諸侯有禮義
則役希起
If the ruler who receives the Lords of the Land comports himself with propriety and righteousness,
conflicts rarely arise.
治民事務本
則淫奢止
If the ruler regulates the peoples' tasks by striving for the fundamentals,
wastefulness and extravagance cease.
凡
馬之所以大用者
外供甲兵
而內給淫奢也
As a general rule,
the things for which horses are mostly used
is to [carry] supplies of armor and weapons outside the state,
while they are used for wasteful and extravagant purposes inside the state.
今有道之君
外希用甲兵
而內禁淫奢
Now a ruler who possesses the Way
will rarely use armor and weapons outside the state
while he will prohibit wastefulness and extravagance inside the state.
上不事馬於戰鬥逐北
而民不以馬遠淫通物
Thus, the ruler has no need for horses to travel back and forth in warfare
and the people have no need for horses to transport extravagant things to and from distant lands.
所積力唯田疇
Instead, the horses' strength is preserved for agricultural pursuits.
積力於田疇
必且糞灌
If the horses' strength is preserved for agricultural pursuits,
it will invariably be used for plowing the fields or hauling water to irrigate them.
故曰
Thus it is said:
"*When the world has the Way,
天下有道
卻走馬以糞也
one relegates swift horses to fertilize [the fields].*"

人君者無道
則內暴虐其民
而外侵欺其鄰國
If the people's ruler is not in possession of the Way,
he will treat the people cruelly and brutally inside [his borders]
while he will attack and deceive neighboring states outside [his borders].
內暴虐
則民產絕
If inside [his borders] he treats his people cruelly and brutally,
their livelihood will be cut off.
外侵欺
則兵數起
If outside [his borders] he attacks and deceives neighboring states,
their troops will rise up repeatedly.
民產絕
則畜生少
If the peoples' livelihood is cut off,
their livestock diminishes.
兵數起
則士卒盡
If troops rise up repeatedly,
his officers and foot soldiers will be consumed.
畜生少
則戎馬乏
If livestock diminishes,
his war-horses will become scarce.
士卒盡
則軍危殆
If officers and foot soldiers are consumed,
his army will perish.
戎馬乏
則將馬出
If war-horses become scarce,
his mares will be brought out to do battle.
軍危殆
則近臣役
If his army perishes,
his intimate servants will take up the defense.
馬者軍之大用
郊者言其近也
Horses are of great use to armies
while [the word] "suburb" refers to their being close [to the capital].
今所以給
軍之具於將馬近臣
Now that is why [under these circumstances],
the ruler must supply mares and intimate servants to replenish the army.
故曰
Thus it is said:
天下無道
戎馬生於郊矣
"*When the world is without the Way,
war-horses breed in the suburbs.*"

人有欲
則計會亂
If people have desires,
their plans and calculations will become confused.
計會亂
而有欲甚
If plans and calculations become confused,
desires will deepen.
有欲甚
則邪心勝
If desires deepen,
the perverted mind will prevail.
邪心勝
則事經絕
If the perverted mind prevails,
undertakings will be led astray and will cut off.
事經絕
則禍難生
If undertakings are led astray and are cut off,
misfortunes and difficulties arise.
由是觀之
禍難生於邪心
邪心誘於可欲
Looking at the matter from this perspective,
misfortunes and difficulties are born of the perverted mind
and the perverted mind is led by things that can be desired.
可欲之類
Things that can be desired [of two] sorts:

> 進
則教良民為姦
if coming in [to the country],
they entice good people to do evil;  
退
則令善人有禍
if leaving [the county],
they cause good people to suffer misfortunes.

姦起
則上侵弱君
If evil arises,
it encroaches upon and weakens the ruler above.
禍至
則民人多傷
If misfortunes arrive,
the people suffer many afflictions.
然
則可欲之類
上侵弱君
而下傷人民
Thus,
things that can be desired
encroach upon and weaken the ruler above,
while they afflict the people below.
夫上侵弱君
而下傷人民者
大罪也
To encroach upon and weaken the ruler above
and afflict the people below
is a grave crime indeed.
故曰
Thus it is said:
禍莫大於可欲
"*There is no calamity greater than a things that can be desired.*"
是以聖人不引五色
不淫於聲樂
This is why the sage is not enticed by the five colors
nor is he sullied by lewd music.
明君賤玩好
而去淫麗
The enlightened ruler scorns amusements and addictions
and avoids the lewd and the lascivious/playful trifles and dazzling beauties.

人無毛羽
People have neither fur nor feathers.
不衣
則不犯寒
Unclad,
they cannot resist the cold.
上不屬天
而下不著地
Above they do not belong to heaven
and below they do not cleave to the earth.
以腸胃為根本
不食
則不能活
Rather, they consider the stomach and intestines as their fundamental root
because if they do not eat
they cannot survive.
是以不免於欲利之心
This is why they cannot avoid possessing minds that desire material benefit.
欲利之心不除
其身之憂也
If they cannot eradicate this mind desirous of material benefit,
they grow anxious.
故聖人衣足以犯寒
食足以充虛
則不憂矣
Therefore the sage wears just enough to resist cold
and eats just enough to satiate hunger
and so he is free from anxiety.
眾人
則不然
Most people, however,
are not like this.
大為諸侯
小餘千金之資
其欲得之憂不除也
Whether you are as important as a regional lord
or as unimportant as a person who merely possesses a surfeit of a thousand pieces of gold,
you cannot eradicate the anxiety that comes along with the desire to obtain material benefit.
胥靡有免
死罪時活
今不知足者之憂
終身不解
Now the convict may receive a pardon
and the criminal sentenced to death may gain a reprieve
but those who {are perplexed because they} do not know contentment
will live out their whole life without being released from such anxiety.
故曰
Thus it is said:
禍莫大於不知足
"*There is no misfortune greater than not knowing contentment.*"

故欲利甚
於憂
Therefore if the desire for material benefit is excessive
there will be anxiety.
憂
則疾生
If there is anxiety,
illness will arise.
疾生
而智慧衰
If illness arises,
wisdom will deteriorate.
智慧衰
則失度量
If wisdom deteriorates,
you will lose the ability to measure and calculate.
失度量
則妄舉動
If you lose the ability to measure and calculate,
your movements and actions will become haphazard.
妄舉動
則禍害至
If your movements and actions become haphazard,
disasters and harms will arrive.
禍害至
而疾嬰內
If disasters and harms arrive,
illness will hamper you inside.
疾嬰內
則痛禍薄外
If illness hampers you inside,
painful diseases will spread to the outside.
痛禍薄外
則苦痛雜於腸胃之間
If painful diseases spread to the outside,
cutting pain will infiltrate the regions of the stomach and intestines.
苦痛雜於腸胃之間
則傷人也憯
If cutting pain infiltrates the regions of the stomach and intestines,
your afflictions will become agonizing.
憯
則退而自咎
If your afflictions become agonizing,
you will retreat and upbraid yourself.
退而自咎也
生於欲利
Retreating and upbraiding yourself
is born of the desire for material benefit.
故曰
Thus it is said:
咎莫憯於欲利
"*There is no disaster more sorrowful than desiring material benefit.*"
