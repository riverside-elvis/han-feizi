## 喻老 Yu Lao 3 (_Laozi_ 26)

制在己
曰重
When control rests in your person,
you are called weighty.
不離位
曰靜
When you do not leave the throne,
you are called tranquil.

> 重
則能使輕
When weighty,
you can direct the light.  
靜
則能使躁
When tranquil,
you can direct the restless.

故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 重為輕根
"*The heavy is the root of the light;*  
靜為躁君
*The tranquil is the lord of the restless.*"

故曰
Therefore it is said:
君子終日行
不離輜重也
"*The superior man travels all day
without becoming separated from his heavy baggage cart.*"

邦者
人君之輜重也
The state
is the ruler's "heavy baggage cart."
主父
When Zhufu [i.e. "Master Father,"
the sobriquet taken by King Wuling of Zhao (r. 325–295 BCE)
after ceding the throne to his son]
生傳其邦
此離其輜重者也
abdicated his state while still alive,
he "became separated from his heavy baggage cart."
故
雖有代雲中之樂
超然已無趙矣
Therefore,
though he enjoyed the music of Dai and Yunzhong,
ultimately he had already lost Zhao.
主父
萬乘之主
而以身輕於天下
Zhufu
was a ruler of a 10,000 chariot state
yet he considered himself "lighter" than the empire.
無勢
之謂輕
When the ruler lacks strategic advantage (*shi*),
he is said to be "light."
離位
之謂躁
When he leaves the throne,
he is said to be "restless."
是以生幽
而死
This is why he lived as a hostage
and subsequently died.[^yu-lao-16]
故曰
Therefore when it says:

[^yu-lao-16]: For the details, see Chen Qiyou 2000: 7.21.436n.5.

> 輕則失臣
"*If light, you will lose your subjects.*  
躁則失君
*If restless, you will lose your lordship,*"

主父之謂也
it refers to Zhufu.
