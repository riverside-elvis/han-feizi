## 喻老 Yu Lao 8 (_Laozi_ 64)

宋之鄙人得璞玉
而獻之子罕
A country bumpkin from Song once came upon a jade stone
that he presented to Zihan [an official known for his incorruptibility].
子罕不受
Zihan refused to accept it.
鄙人曰
The country bumpkin then said:
此寶也
"This is a treasure.
宜為君子器
不宜為細人用
It is suitable to be made into the utensil of a gentleman
and certainly is not suitable for the use of such a rustic as me."
子罕曰
Zihan replied:
爾以玉為寶
我以不受子玉為寶
"You regard the jade to be a treasure
but I regard refusing to accept it to be equally precious."
是鄙人欲玉
而子罕不欲玉
Thus though the country bumpkin desired the jade
Zihan did not.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
欲不欲
而不貴難得之貨
"*Desire not to desire
and do not value goods that are hard to obtain.*"

王壽負書而行
見徐馮於周塗
Wang Shou was travelling with a bundle of books on his back
when he bumped into Xu Feng on the road in Zhou.
馮曰
Feng remarked:
事者為也
"Any undertaking is a purposeful act (wei);
為生於時
知者無常事
purposeful acts are generated by the times
so that those who possess knowledge avoid permanent/constant undertakings.
書者言也
Books consist of words;
言生於知
知者不藏書
words are generated by knowledge
so that those who possess knowledge do not prize keeping books.
今子何獨負之而行
Why then,
should you alone burden yourself with them?"
於是王壽因焚其書而舞之
Hearing this,
Wang Shou burned the books and danced with joy.
故
知者
不以言談教
Thus,
those who possess knowledge
do rely upon words to discuss their teachings;
而慧者
不以藏書篋
while the truly knowledgeable
do not fill their libraries with books.
此世之所過也
而王壽復之
This is what our age has passed by
yet Wang Shou returned to it.
是學不學也
Such is learning to be without learning.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
學不學
復歸眾人之所過也
"*Learn to not learn
and return to what the multitudes pass by.*"

夫物有常容
Now things possess their constant dispositions.
因乘
以導之
Follow along and avail yourself of them
and you will thereby direct them.
故因隨物之容
If you follow along with the dispositions of things, then

> 靜
則建乎德
when quiescent,
you will be established in Potency;  
動
則順乎道
when in motion,
you will be compliant with the Way.

宋人有為其君以象為楮葉者
A native of Song made a mulberry leaf out of ivory for his ruler.
三年而成
It took 3 years for him to complete it.
豐殺莖柯
毫芒繁澤
亂之楮葉之中
而不可別也
Having a stem and veins, wide and narrow,
a tiny bud and colorful gloss,
it was mixed in amongst real mulberry leaves
and [no one] could tell the difference.
此人遂
以功
食祿於宋邦
In the end,
on account of his skill
this man was endowed with a bounty in the state of Song.

列子聞之曰
When Liezi heard of this he remarked:
使天地三年
而成一葉
則物之有葉者寡矣
"Suppose it were to take Heaven and Earth 3 years
to make a leaf;
then there would be few things that had leaves."
故
不乘天地之資
而載一人之身
不隨道理之數
而學一人之智
此皆一葉之行也
Therefore,
if you do not avail yourself of the natural proclivities of Heaven and Earth
but rather rely on one man
or if you do not follow the various enumerations of the ordering principles of the Way
but rather study the knowledge of one man,
you will in every case be following the conduct of the singular mulberry leaf.
故
冬耕之稼
后稷不能羨也
Therefore,
if you farm in winter,
even Lord Millet will not be able to turn out crops;
豐年大禾
臧獲不能惡也
rich harvests in years of abundance
even bondmen and bondmaids could not spoil.
以一人力
則后稷不足
Therefore,
if you depend on the strength of one man,
then even Lord Millet will not be sufficient to the task;
隨自然
則臧獲有餘
but if you follow what is natural (*ziran*),
then even [the farming of] bondmen and bondmaids will yield a surplus.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
恃萬物之自然
而不敢為也
"*Rely on the naturalness of the myriad creatures
and do not dare to act.*"
