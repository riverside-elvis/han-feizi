## 喻老 Yu Lao 6 (_Laozi_ 64)

昔晉
公子重耳出亡
過鄭
In ancient times,
when Prince Chong'er [i.e. Duke Wen] of Jin was fleeing,
he passed through the state of Zheng.
鄭君不禮
The ruler of Zheng failed to treat him according to the proper etiquette.
叔瞻諫曰
Shuzhan remonstrated, saying:
此賢公子也
君厚待之
可以積德
"This is a worthy prince.
If Your Highness treats him generously [now]
you will be able to curry his favor [in the future]."
鄭君不聽
The Lord of Zheng did not heed his advice.
叔瞻又諫曰
Again,
Shuzhan admonished him saying:
不厚待之
不若殺之
無令有後患
"If Your Highness is unwilling to treat him generously
then it would be best to murder him
and avoid a calamity in the future".
鄭君又不聽
Again,
the Lord of Zheng did not heed his advice.
及公子返晉邦
舉兵
伐鄭
大破之
取八城焉
When the prince returned home to the state of Jin,
he raised troops,
attacked Zheng,
roundly defeating it
and capturing eight of its cities.

晉獻公以垂棘之璧假
道於虞而伐虢
When Duke Xian of Jin hoped by using the jade disk of Chuiji
to obtain free passage from [the state of] Yu to attack [the state of] Guo.
大夫宮之奇諫曰
The Great Officer Gong Zhiji admonished him, saying:
不可
"You cannot.
脣亡
而齒寒
When the lips are gone,
the teeth grow cold.
虞虢相救
非相德也
今日晉滅虢
明日虞必隨之亡
Yu and Guo must rescue one another,
not because they want to mutually curry favor,
but because if Jin destroys Guo today,
tomorrow Yu will follow on its heels to ruin".
虞君不聽
The Lord of Yu did not listen.
受其璧
而假之道
He accepted the jade
and granted [Jin] free passage.
晉已取虢
還反滅虞
The [ruler of Jin] took Guo
and on his return he attacked Yu.

此二臣者
皆爭於腠理者也
而二君不用也
These two ministers
both struggled with [the illnesses of state] when still at the "pores of the skin"
but their rulers did not heed their advice.
然則叔瞻宮
之奇亦虞鄭之扁鵲也
而二君不聽
故鄭以破
虞以亡
Though Shuzhan and Gong Zhiji
were the calling crows of Yu and Guo,
because their rulers did not listen,
consequently Zheng was destroyed
and Yu was annihilated.

故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 其安易持也
"*What is secure is easily maintained,  
其未兆易謀也
What is not yet ominous is easily forestalled.*"
