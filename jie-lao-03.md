## 解老 Jie Lao 3 (_Laozi_ 59)

聰明睿智天也
Acuity of hearing, clarity of sight, intuition and wisdom are due to Heaven.
動靜思慮人也
Activity, repose, reflection and planning are due to humankind.
人也者
Those who are human

> 乘於天明以視
avail themselves of Heaven's clarity to see;  
寄於天聰以聽
rely on Heaven's acuity to hear;  
託於天智以思慮
depend on Heaven's wisdom to reflect and plan.

故
Thus,

> 視強
則目不明
if sight is strained,
eyes will not see clearly;  
聽甚
則耳不聰
if hearing is overwrought,
ears will not hear acutely;  
思慮過度
則智識亂
if reflection and planning exceed proper limits,
understanding will become chaotic.  
目不明
則不能決黑白之分
If eyes do not see clearly,
they cannot discern the difference between black and white;  
耳不聰
則不能別清濁之聲
if ears do not hear acutely,
they cannot distinguish the high from the low note;[^jie-lao-7]  
智識亂
則不能審得失之地
if understanding is chaotic,
it cannot fathom the causes of success and failure.  
目不能決黑白之色
則謂之盲
If eyes cannot discern the difference between black and white,
it is called blindness;  
耳不能別清濁之聲
則謂之聾
if ears cannot distinguish a high note from a low note,
it is called deafness;  
心不能審得失之地
則謂之狂
if understanding cannot fathom the causes of success and failure,
it is called daftness.  
盲
則不能避晝日之險
If blind,
you cannot avoid dangers in broad daylight;  
聾
則不能知雷霆之害
if deaf,
you cannot comprehend the harm accompanying the clap of thunder  
狂
則不能免人間法令之禍
if daft,
you cannot avoid the disasters [attendant upon violating] the laws and ordinances pertaining to the populace.

[^jie-lao-7]: This is a somewhat free rendering of *qing* 清 and *zhuo* 濁.
They literally mean "clear" and "turbid," respectively,
and in some cases also seem to refer to "tempered" and "untempered" scales.
See Major et al. 2010: 931.

書之所謂治人者
The text's reference to "*governing the people*" means

> 適動靜之節
to suit the rhythms of [the people's] activity and repose [among the populace],  
省思慮之費也
and to minimize their wasting time thinking and planning.

所謂事天者
The reference to "*serving Heaven*" means

> 不極聰明之力
not pressing to the limit the strength of your hearing or eyesight,  
不盡智識之任
and not exhausting the faculties of your wisdom and knowledge.

苟極盡
則費神多
If you press to the limit or exhaust [such faculties],
you will greatly expend your spirit.
費神多
則盲聾悖狂之禍至
If you greatly expend your spirit,
disasters from blindness, deafness, and daftness will befall you.
是以嗇之
This is precisely why you must be sparing of such faculties.
嗇之者
愛其精神
嗇其智識也
Being sparing of such faculties,
you will cherish your quintessential spirit
and be sparing of your wise knowledge.
故曰
Thus it is said:
治人事天
莫如嗇
"*For governing the people and serving Heaven
nothing compares to being sparing.*"

眾人之用神也
躁
When the majority of people use their spirit,
they do so rashly.
躁
則多費
Being rash,
they expend much of their spirit.
多費
之謂侈
Greatly expending their spirit,
they are said to be wasteful.
聖人之用神也
靜
When sages use their spirit,
they do so tranquilly.
靜
則少費
Being tranquil,
they expend very little of their spirit.
少費
之謂嗇
Expending very little of their spirit,
they are said to be sparing.
嗇
之謂術也生於道理
To be sparing,
constitutes a technique that is born of the ordering principles of the Way.
夫
能嗇也
是從於道
而服於理者也
Indeed,
those who can be sparing
follow the Way
and submit to its ordering principles.
眾人離於患
陷於禍
猶未知退
而不服從道理
Most people who encounter trouble
or are entangled by disasters
still do not know to retreat
and submit to and follow the ordering principles of the Way.
聖人雖未見禍患之形
虛無服
從於道理
以稱蚤服
Yet even before disaster or trouble appear,
empty and non-active,
the sage submits to and follows the ordering principles of the Way
and so the sage is said to "submit early on [to the Way]."
故曰
Thus it is said:
夫謂嗇
是以蚤服
"*For only if you are sparing
will you early on submit [to the Way].*"

> 知治人者其思慮靜
The thought of those who know how to govern the people is tranquil;  
知事天者其孔竅虛
The apertures of those who know how to serve Heaven are empty.  
思慮靜
故德不去
When thought is tranquil,
previously [accumulated] potency will not leave [the body].  
孔竅虛
則和氣日入
When apertures are empty,
harmonious qi will daily enter [the body].

故曰
Thus the expression:
重積德
"*repeatedly accumulating potency.*"

夫能令故德不去
新和氣日至者
蚤服者也
Now those who are able to direct the previously [accumulated] potency not to leave [the body]
and the new harmonious qi to daily enter [the body],
are those who early on submit.[^jie-lao-8]

[^jie-lao-8]: Note the similarity of this language
with contemporary medico-sexual literature.

故曰
Thus it is said:
蚤服是謂重積德
"*Early submission-this refers to repeatedly accumulating potency.*"

> 積德
而後神靜
Only after you accumulate potency,
will your spirit become tranquil.  
神靜
而後和多
Only after your spirit becomes tranquil,
will a sense of harmony pervade.  
和多
而後計得
Only after a sense of harmony pervades,
will your plans be realized.  
計得
而後能御萬物
Only after your plans are realized,
can you manage the myriad things.

能御萬物
則戰易勝敵
If you can manage the myriad things,
in battle you will easily defeat the enemy.
戰易勝敵
而論必蓋世
If in battle you easily defeat the enemy,
your judgments will invariably prevail over the age.
論必蓋世
故曰
無不克
Since your judgments invariably prevail over the age,
there is the expression:
"*there is nothing that you cannot overcome.*"
無不克
本於重積德
There being nothing that one cannot overcome
is rooted in your repeatedly accumulating potency.
故曰
Thus it is said:
重積德
則無不克
"*When you repeatedly accumulate potency
there is nothing that you cannot overcome.*"

戰易勝敵
則兼有天下
If you easily defeat your enemy in battle,
you will unite all the states in the world.
論必蓋世
則民人從
If you judgments invariably prevail over the age,
the people will submit.
進
兼天下
Advancing,
you will unite the world;
而退
從民人
while retreating,
the people will follow.
其術遠
則眾人莫見其端末
Since your techniques are far reaching,
the majority of people will not perceive their roots or their branches.
莫見其端末
是以莫知其極
Since no one will perceive either their roots or branches,
no one will know their limits.
故曰
Thus it is said:
無不克
則莫知其極
"*When there is nothing you cannot overcome,
no one will know your limits.*"

凡
有國
而後亡之
有身
而後殃之
不可謂
能有其國
能保其身
As a general rule,
those who first possess a state
and then lose it
or those who first preserve their body
and then die prematurely
cannot be said to be
capable of possessing their states
or preserving their bodies.
夫能有其國
必能安其社稷
能保其身
必能終其天年
Those who possess a state
must be capable of maintaining the security of their Altars of Land and Grain
while those who preserve their bodies
must be capable of living out their naturally allotted lifespans.
而後可謂
能有其國
能保其身矣
Only then can it be said
that they are capable of possessing their states
or preserving their bodies.
夫
能有其國
保其身者
必且體道
Indeed,
to be able to possess a state
or preserve the body
you must embody the Way.
體道
則其智深
If you embody the Way,
your wisdom will deepen.
其智深
則其會遠
As your wisdom deepens,
your comprehension will become far-reaching.
其會遠
眾人莫能見其所極
If your comprehension becomes far-reaching,
the majority of people will not be able to detect its limit.
唯夫能令人
不見其事極
Only if you embody the Way will you be able to ensure that other people
will not detect the limit of your undertakings.
不見事極者
為保其身
有其國
If others do not detect the limit of your undertakings
you will be able to preserve your person
and take possession of a state.
故曰
Thus it is said:
{莫知其極}
莫知其極
則可以有國
"*When no one knows your limits,
you will be able to take possession of the state.*"

所謂有國之母
母者
道也
The term "*mother*"
in the expression "*to possess the mother of the state*"
refers to the Way.
道也者生於所以有國之術
The Way is born of the techniques by which you possess the state.
所以有國之術
故謂之有國之母
Because it is the techniques by which you possess the state,
it is referred to as "*possessing the mother of the state.*"
夫
道以與世周旋者
其建生也長
持祿也久
Indeed,
if you use the Way to move and operate in perfect accord with the age,
in maintaining your life you will persevere
and in maintaining your emoluments you will endure.
故曰
Thus it is said:
有國之母
可以長久
"*If you possess the mother of the state,
you can long endure.*"

樹木有曼根
有直根
Trees possess roots that spread
and those that penetrate straight down into the soil.
根者
書之所謂柢也
The roots that penetrate straight down into the soil
are what the text calls the "tap roots."


> 柢也者
木之所以建生也
The "tap roots"
are the means by which the tree establishes life.  
曼根者
木之所以持生也
The spreading roots
are the means by which the tree maintains life.  
德也者
人之所以建生也
Potency
is the means by which people establish life.  
祿也者
人之所以持生也
Emoluments
are the means by which people support life.

今建於理者
其持祿也久
Now if you establish yourself with the ordering principles of the Way,
you will maintain emoluments for a long time.
故曰
Thus it states:
深其根
"*Deepen the roots.*"
體其道者
其生日長
If you embody the Way,
you will extend your life.
故曰
Thus it is said:
固其柢
"*Secure the roots.*"
柢固
則生長
根深
則視久
If the roots are secure,
life will be long
and if the roots are deep,
vision will be long lasting.
故曰
Thus it is said:
深其根
固其柢
"*Deepen and secure the roots.
長生久視之道也
This is the Way of long life and long-lasting vision.*"
