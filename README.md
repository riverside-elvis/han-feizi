# Appendix: Transcriber's Notes

This is a mashup of
base text from [ctext](https://ctext.org/hanfeizi/)
and Sarah A. Queen's
translation of _Han Feizi_ Chapters 20 and 21
from "_Han Feizi_ and the Old Master"
in _Dao Companion to the Philosophy of Han Fei_,
P.R. Goldin, editor, 2013.

Queen's base text is from
Chen Qiyou 陳奇猷, _Han Feizi, with new collations and commentary_ 韓非子新校注, 2000.
I couldn't find a digital copy,
so I've used ctext instead.
Judging from Queen's translation,
there are a few differences
between base texts,
so I've put curly braces
around words and phrases in ctext
that Queen hasn't translated
or that don't match Queen's translation,
and around phrases that Queen has translated but are missing from ctext.

See the original article for Queen's analysis.
