## 解老 Jie Lao 11 (_Laozi_ 54)

人無愚智
莫不有趨舍
People whether stupid or wise,
never fail [to be able] to accept and reject [things].
恬淡平安
莫不知禍福之所由來
Whether indifferent or tranquil,
they never fail to understand the causes of ill and good fortune.
得於好惡
怵於淫物
而後變亂
But if people become caught up in their likes and dislikes
and beguiled by extravagant things,
only then do they change and become disordered.
所以然者
引於外物
亂於玩好也
The reason that this is so
is due to the fact that they are enticed by external things
and disordered by their playful preferences.
恬淡有趨舍之義
平安知禍福之計
When indifferent they can ascertain the significance of rejecting and accepting
and if secure they understand how to calculate ill and good fortune.
而今也玩好變之
外物引之
引之而往
Yet if playful preferences change them
and external things entice them,
they follow what entices them.
故曰拔
Thus the expression "*uprooted.*"

至聖人不然
Coming to a sage, however, this is not so.
一建其趨舍
雖見所好
之物不能引
Once the sage establishes that which he rejects and accepts,
although he may see things that he desires
they are unable to entice him.
不能引
之謂不拔
Since he cannot be enticed
it is said he is "*not uprooted.*"
一於其情
雖有可欲之類
神不為動
The sage is one with his emotions
so that even though he may encounter things that are desirable,
his spirit remains unperturbed.
神不為動
之謂不脫
Since his spirit remains unperturbed
it is called "*not slipping away.*"
為人子孫者
體此道以守宗廟不滅
之謂祭祀不絕
If as a son or grandson,
you embody this way in order to preserve the ancestral temples from destruction
this is called "*sacrifice without end.*"

> 身以積精為德
The body accumulates vital essence to become potent,  
家以資財為德
the family accumulates possessions and property to become potent,  
鄉國天下皆以民為德
the village, state, and world, rely on their people to become potent.

今治身
而外物不能亂其精神
Now if you regulate yourself,
external things cannot disturb your quintessential spirit.
故曰
Thus it is said:
脩之身
其德乃真
"*If you cultivate it in your person,
your potency will be genuine.*"

真者{慎}之固也
"Genuine" refers to the stability of your potency.
治家
無用之物不能動其計
則資有餘
For those who manage the family,
if useless things cannot disturb their calculations,
their families will enjoy a surplus of goods.
故曰
Thus it is said:
脩之家
其德有餘
"*If you cultivate it in your family,
your potency will overflow.*"

治鄉者行此節
則家之有餘者益眾
When those who manage a village act on such regulation,
those families who possess a surplus of goods will increase and multiply.
故曰
Thus it is said:
脩之鄉
其德乃長
"*If you cultivate it in your village,
your potency will be long lasting.*"

治邦者行此節
則鄉之有德者益眾
When those who manage states act on such regulation,
those within the states who possess potency will increase and multiply.
故曰
Thus it is said:
脩之邦
其德乃豐
"*If you cultivate it in your state,
your potency will be abundant.*"

蒞天下者行此節
則民之生莫不受其澤
When those who rule the world act on such regulation,
the lives of the common people will all benefit from his kindness.
故曰
Thus it is said:
脩之天下
其德乃普
"*If you cultivate it in the world,
your potency will be pervasive.*"

脩身者以此
別君子小人
Those who cultivate themselves by means of this [principle of regulation]
will distinguish the Gentleman from the petty man.
治鄉治邦蒞天下者各以此
科適觀息耗
則萬不失一
Each of those who manage villages, states, and oversee the world by means of this [principle of regulation]
will judge production and consumption and never err,
not a single time in 10,000.
故曰
Thus it is said:
以身觀身
"*Use the individual to examine the individual;*
以家觀家
*the family to examine the family;*
以鄉觀鄉
*the village to examine the village;*
以邦觀邦
*the state to examine the state;*
以天下觀天下
*and the world to examine the world.*
吾奚以知天下之然也
*How do I know that the world is so?*
以此
*By means of this.*"
