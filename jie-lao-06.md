## 解老 Jie Lao 6 (_Laozi_ 14)

道者
The Way:

> 萬物之所然也
Is what makes the myriad kinds of things so,  
萬理之所稽也
And what fixes the myriad principles of things.

理者
成物之文也
道者
萬物之所以成也
[These] ordering principles
are the patterns of completed things
and the Way
is the means by which all things are completed.
故曰
Thus it is said:
道理之者也
"*The Way constitutes the ordering principles
{of the myriad things}.*"

物有理
不可以相薄
Things have their ordering principles
and cannot overlap with one another.
物有理
不可以相薄
故理之為物之制
Since things have ordering principles
and cannot overlap with one another,
ordering principles are the determinants of things.
萬物各異理
Each of the myriad things in the world possesses a different ordering principle.
萬物各異理而
道盡稽萬物之理
故不得不化
Since each of the myriad things in the world possesses a different ordering principle
and the Way to the very last fixes the ordering principles of things,
consequently [the Way] cannot but transform.
不得不化
故無常操
Since the Way cannot but transform,
it has no constant frame [of activity].
無常操
Since the Way has no constant frame [of activity],

> 是以死生氣稟焉
Life and death have their endowments of qi because of it,  
萬智斟酌焉
the myriad [kinds of] knowledge are deliberated because of it,  
萬事廢興焉
and the myriad [kinds of] affairs succeed or fail because of it.  
天得之以高
Heaven obtains it and so is high;  
地得之以藏
Earth obtains it and so stores things away;  
維斗得之以成其威
the Polar Star obtains it and so achieves its majesty;  
日月得之以恆其光
the sun and the moon obtain it and so are constantly radiant;  
五常得之以常其位
the five constants obtain it and so maintain their positions;  
列星得之以端其行
the arrayed stars obtain it and so arrange their orbits;  
四時得之以御其變氣
the four seasons obtain it and so regulate the transformations of their qi,  
軒轅得之以擅四方
Xuanyuan [i.e. the Yellow Thearch] obtained it and so ruled over the four quarters,  
赤松得之與天地統
Master Red Pine [a famed immortal] obtained it and so lives as long as Heaven and Earth,  
聖人得之以成文章
and the sages obtained it and so perfected cultural patterns and elaborate institutions because of it.

道
The Way shared in

> 與堯舜俱智
the wisdom of Yao and Shun;  
與接輿俱狂
the madness of Jieyu;[^jie-lao-9]  
與桀紂俱滅
the destruction of [the tyrants] Jie and Zhòu;  
與湯武俱昌
and in the prosperity of [the sage kings] Tang and Wu.  
以為近乎
遊於四極
Consider it near by,
and it wanders to the four directions;  
以為遠乎
常在吾側
Consider it far away,
and it is right by your side.  
以為暗乎
其光昭昭
Consider it dark,
and its brilliance is radiant and resplendent.  
以為明乎
其物冥冥
Consider it bright,
and its materiality is dark and dim.

[^jie-lao-9]: See _Analects_ 18.5.

而
Yet

> 功成天地
its achievements perfect the universe;  
和化雷霆
and its harmony transforms its thunder.

{宇內之物}
恃之以成
[Thus] all things in the world
depend on the Way for its completion.
凡
道之情
不制不形
As a general rule,
the true character of the Way
neither fixes [things] nor gives shape [to things].
柔弱
隨時
與理相應
It is weak and soft
and accords with the seasons,
and is mutually responsive to the ordering principles [of things].

> 萬物得之以{死}
得之以{生}
The myriad things obtain it and so live;
obtain it and so die.  
萬事得之以敗
得之以成
The myriad affairs obtain it and so fail;
obtain it and so succeed.  
道譬諸若水
The Way is comparable to water.  
溺者多飲之
即死
If a drowning person drinks too much of it,
he dies;  
渴者適飲之
即生
If a thirsty person drinks just enough of it,
he lives.  
譬之若劍戟
It is comparable to a sword or a spear.  
愚人以行忿
則禍生
If a fool uses it to repay a grudge,
ill fortune arises.  
聖人以誅暴
則福成
If the sage uses it to punish the tyrannical,
good fortune results.

故
Thus [it is said]:[^jie-lao-10]
得之以死
"*Obtaining it [you] die because of it;
得之以生
obtaining it [you] live because of it;
得之以敗
obtaining it [you] fail because of it,
得之以成
obtaining it [you] succeed because of it.*"[^jie-lao-11]

[^jie-lao-10]: Supplying *yue* 曰 (see Chen Qiyou 2000: 6.20.413n.18).

[^jie-lao-11]: There is quite a bit of debate among commentators
over how precisely to interpret this passage
that does not appear to quote the _Laozi_.
Some commentators maintain that the passage quotes the Laozi,
but in the first instance the quoted line has been altered
and in the second the quoted line has been lost to posterity.
Other commentators have argued that this passage
does not cite the _Laozi_ at all.
The passage closes with a set of rhymed lines
that are unique to this text (see Chen Qiyou 2000: 6.20.413n.18).
My own sense is that this passage
exhibits closest affinities
with the "Daoyuan" 道原 chapter of the
_Silk Manuscripts of Huang-Lao_ and "Yuandao" 原道 chapter of the _Huainanzi_,
and that these affinities merit further investigation.

人希見生象也
People rarely observe a living elephant.
而得死象之骨
案其圖
以想其生也
Yet if they come across the skeleton of a dead elephant,
they examine the layout of the bones
and envision it alive.
故諸人之所以意想者皆
謂之象也
Thus the means by which people imagine things
is called "*an elephant/an image.*"
今
道雖不可得聞見
聖人執其見功
以處見其形
Now,
though the Way can be neither heard nor seen,
the sage grasps its observable effects
in order to surmise its form.
故曰
Thus it is said:
無狀之狀
無物之象
"*This is called the form that lacks form,
the image/elephant that lacks materiality.*"
