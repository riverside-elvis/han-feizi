## 解老 Jie Lao 10 (_Laozi_ 53)

> 書之所謂大道也者
端道也
What the book refers to as "*the great Way*"
means the orthodox way.  
所謂貌施也者
邪道也
What it refers to as "*going astray*"
means the heterodox way.  
所謂徑大也者
佳麗也
What it refers to as "*narrow paths*"
means beautiful decorations.

佳麗也者
邪道之分也
Beautiful decorations
are the allotments of the heterodox way.
朝甚除也者
獄訟繁也
"*The courts are swept very clean*"
means that litigations proliferate.

獄訟繁
則田荒
If litigations proliferate,
the fields will become desolate.
田荒
則府倉虛
If the fields are desolate,
the government granaries will become empty.
府倉虛
則國貧
If the government granaries are empty,
the state will become impoverished.
國貧
而民俗淫侈
The state becomes impoverished
but the people remain accustomed to extravagance and waste.
民俗淫侈
則衣食之業絕
If the people remain accustomed to extravagance and waste,
the occupations that produce clothing and food will cease to exist.
衣食之業絕
則民不得無飾巧詐
If the occupations that produce clothing and food cease to exist,
the people will have no choice but to be deceptive and cunning in cheating others.
飾巧詐
則知采文
If the people are deceptive and cunning in cheating others,
they will come to know the colored and embroidered [clothing].
知采文之
謂
服文采
Knowing the embroidered and colored
is referenced as "*Clothed in embroidered and colored [garb].*"

獄訟繁
倉廩虛
而有以淫侈為俗
則國之傷也若以利劍刺之
When litigations are numerous,
if the granaries are empty,
and if extravagance and waste become customary,
the state will suffer injury as though pierced by a sharp sword.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
帶利劍
"*At their waists they carry sharp swords.*"

諸夫飾智
故以至於傷國者
其私家必富
Those men who ornament their knowledge
also injure the state,
as their own families invariably become wealthy.
私家必富
故曰
Since their families invariably become wealthy,
it states:
資貨有餘
"*Their goods and possessions overflow.*"

國有若是者
則愚民不得無術而效之
If the state has people like this,
simple folks cannot help but imitate them without measure.
效之
則小盜生
Imitating them without measure,
all kinds of petty thievery arise.
由是觀之
大姦作
則小盜隨
Looking at the matter from this perspective,
wherever great villains operate,
petty thieves are sure to follow.
大姦唱
則小盜和
Wherever great thieves take the lead,
petty thieves are sure to join in.
竽也者
五聲之長者也
Indeed, the Yu
is the lead musical instrument for the Five Notes.
故
竽先
則鍾瑟皆隨
Therefore,
if the Yu instrument leads off,
the bells and lutes all follow.
竽唱
則諸樂皆和
When the Yu instrument takes the lead,
all the other instruments join in.
今大姦作
則俗之民唱
Nowadays the great villains operate
and it has become customary for the people to sing along with them.
俗之民唱
則小盜必和
When it becomes customary for the people to sing along,
petty thieves will surely join in.
故
Thus:
服文采
"*Clothed in embroidered and colored [garb].*
帶利劍
*At their waists they carry sharp swords.*
厭飲食
*They gorge themselves on food.*
而貨資有餘者
*Their possessions and goods overflow.*
是之謂盜竽矣
*They are what is called the Yu instrument of thievery.*"
