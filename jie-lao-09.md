## 解老 Jie Lao 9 (_Laozi_ 67)

> 愛子者慈於子
Those who love their children treat their children compassionately;  
重生者慈於身
those who value life treat their bodies compassionately;  
貴功者慈於事
those who prize achievements treat their affairs compassionately.

慈母之於弱子也
務致其福
In tending her vulnerable children, the compassionate mother
strives to bring about their wellbeing.
務致其福
則事除其禍
In striving to bring about their wellbeing,
she will endeavor to eradicate any misfortunes that may befall them.
事除其禍
則思慮熟
In eradicating any misfortune that may befall them,
her reflections and considerations will be thorough.
思慮熟
則得事理
{得事理}
則必成功
Her reflections and considerations being thorough,
she will apprehend the ordering principles of affairs
and will invariably achieve success.
必成功
則其行之也不疑
Invariably achieving success,
she will not waiver in her actions.
不疑之謂勇
Not wavering is called "courage."
聖人之於萬事也
盡如慈母之為弱子慮也
故見必行之道
The sage approaches the myriad affairs in the world
as the compassionate mother considers the well being of her vulnerable children
and so he perceives the Way that must be carried out.
見必行之道
則明
其從事
亦不疑
Perceiving the Way that must be carried out,
he is enlightened
and in carrying out his various tasks
he does not waiver.
不疑之謂勇
Not wavering is called "courage."
不疑生於慈
The ability not to waiver is born of compassion.
故曰
Thus it is said:
慈故
能勇
"*It is because you are compassionate,
that you can be courageous.*"

周公曰
The Duke of Zhou said:
冬日之閉凍也不固
則春夏之長草木也不茂
"When the freezing that brings on hibernation during the winter months is not substantial,
the growth of the grasses and trees in spring and summer will not be luxuriant."
天地不能常侈常費
而況於人乎
If Heaven and Earth cannot constantly waste and constantly expend,
how much more is this the case if it comes to people.
故
Therefore,

> 萬物必有盛衰
the myriad things invariably have their prosperity and decline;  
萬事必有弛張
the myriad affairs invariably have their rise and fall;  
國家必有文武
the dynastic states invariably have their civilian and military undertakings;  
官治必有賞罰
and official regulations invariably have their rewards and punishments.

是以
Thus,

> 智士儉用其財則家富
the wise scholar frugally utilizes his resources and so his family becomes wealthy;  
聖人愛寶其神則精盛
the sagely person lovingly cherishes his spirit and so his essence prospers;  
人君重戰其卒則民眾
the people’s ruler gravely marshals his troops and so his people proliferate.

民眾
則國廣
When the people proliferate,
the state will become extensive.
是以舉之曰
This is why there is praise and there is the statement:
儉故
能廣
"*It is because you are frugal,
that you can be extensive.*"

	
凡
物之有形者易裁也
易割也
As a general rule,
anything that has shape
can be easily discriminated and distinguished.
何以論之
How should this be discussed?
有形
則有短長
If it has shape,
it may be short or long.
有短長
則有小大
Being short or long,
it may be small or large.
有小大
則有方圓
Being small or large,
it may be square or round.
有方圓
則有堅脆
Being square or round,
it may be hard or soft.
有堅脆
則有輕重
Being hard or soft,
it may be light or heavy.
有輕重
則有白黑
Being light or heavy
it may be white or black.
[If something has a shape,
it must have length;
if it has length,
it must have size;
if it has size,
it must have shape;
if it has shape,
it must have solidity;
if it has solidity,
it must have weight;
if it has weight,
it must have color.]
{短長
大小
方圓
堅脆
輕重
白黑}
之謂理
Now length,
size,
shape,
solidity,
weight,
and color
are called ordering principles.
理定
而物易割也
Since ordering principles are fixed,
things are easily discriminated.
故議於大庭
而後言則立
權議之士知之矣
Therefore scholars who weigh public opinion,
know to first debate issues within the great court
before seeking to establish their opinions.
故欲成方圓
而隨其規矩
則萬事之功形矣
Therefore if you desire to construct a square or circle,
you must likewise first follow the compass and square,
and then the achievements of your myriad undertakings will surely take form.
而萬物莫不有規矩
議言之士
計會規矩也
Since the myriad things in the world all possess their compass and squares,
the scholars who speak from public opinion
plan according to and anticipate such compasses and squares.
聖人盡隨於萬物之規矩
The sage thoroughly follows the compass and square of the myriad things in the world.
故曰
Thus there is the expression:
不敢為天下先
"*He does not presume to be first in the world.*"

不敢為天下先
則事無不事
功無不功
而議必蓋世
If you do not presume to be first in the world,
all your undertakings will be undertaken,
all your achievements will be achieved,
and your opinions will inevitably prevail over the age.
欲無處大官
其可得乎
Though you desire to be free of high office,
would it be possible to realize such a desire?
處大官
之謂為成事長
To occupy a high office
is called "being a leader in completing affairs."
是以故曰
Thus it is said:
不敢為天下先
故能為成事長
"*It is because you do not presume to be first in the world,
that you can be a leader in completing affairs.*"

> 慈於子者
不敢絕衣食
Those who treat their children compassionately
do not dare withhold clothing and food.  
慈於身者
不敢離法度
Those who treat their persons compassionately
do not dare depart from laws and measures.  
慈於方圓者
不敢舍規矩
Those who love shapes
do not dare abandon compass and square.

故
臨兵
而慈於士吏
則戰勝敵
Therefore,
if about to deploy troops,
if you are compassionate toward the rank and file,
you will vanquish the enemy in battle.
慈於器械
則城堅固
If you are compassionate toward the instruments and implements of war,
your city walls will be secure and stable.
故曰
Thus it is said:
慈於戰
則勝
以守
則固
"*When compassionate in attacking,
you will win
and in defending,
you will hold firm.*"

夫能自全也
而盡隨於萬物之理者
必且有天生
If you can keep yourself whole
and thoroughly follow the ordering principles of the myriad things of the world,
you will inevitably enjoy a natural vitality.
天生也者
生心也
A natural vitality
means a vital heart.
故天下之道盡之生也
若以慈衛之也
Therefore the Way fully develops this vitality,
as though relying on compassion to defend it.
事必萬全
而舉無不當
則謂之寶矣
If your undertakings are always successful
and everything you initiate is suitable to the circumstances,
it is called a treasure.
故曰
Thus it is said:
吾有三寶
持而寶之
"*I have three treasures
which I hold on to and treasure.*"
