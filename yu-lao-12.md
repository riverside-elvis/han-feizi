## 喻老 Yu Lao 12 (_Laozi_ 27)

周有玉版
In the State of Zhou there was a jade tablet.
紂令膠鬲索之
King Zhòu sent Jiao Ge to ask for it.
文王不予
King Wen did not give it to him.
費仲來求
因予之
Later, Bi Zhong [a sycophantic minister of King Zhòu] came for it
and King Wen gave it to him.
是膠鬲賢
而費仲無道也
This was due to the fact that Jiao Ge was worthy
while Bi Zhong was unscrupulous.
周惡賢者之得志也
故予費仲
Because Zhou hated to see a worthy obtain his ambition,
he gave the tablet to Bi Zhong.
文王舉太公於渭濱者
貴之也
而資費仲玉版者
是愛之也
King Wen raised up the Grand Duke from the banks of the Wei River
because he respected him,
and he gave the jade tablet to Bi Zhong
because he loved him.
故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 不貴其師
"*Not prizing his teacher;*  
不愛其資
*Not cherishing his inherent substance;*  
雖知
大迷
*Though knowledgeable,
he is greatly bewildered.*  
是謂要妙
*This is called the essential mystery.*"
