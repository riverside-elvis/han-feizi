## 喻老 Yu Lao 9 (_Laozi_ 47)

空竅者
神明之戶牖也
The orifices
are the doors and windows of one's spiritual illumination.
耳目竭於聲色
精神竭於外貌
When the ears and eyes are exhausted by sound and color,
one's quintessential spirit will be exhausted by external attractions.
故中無主
Therefore within you will lack a master.
中無主
則禍福雖如丘山
無從識之
When you lack a master inside your body,
then ill and good fortune will pile up like hills and mountains
without your being aware of it.
故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 不出於戶
可以知天下
"*Without going out your door,
you can know the whole world;*  
不闚於牖
可以知天道
*Without peering out your window,
you can know the Way of Heaven.*"

{此言神明之不離其實也}

趙襄主學御於王子期
Lord Xiang of Zhao [d. 425 BCE] studied charioteering from Wang Yuqi.[^yu-lao-23]
俄而與於期逐
All at once he started racing with Yuqi.
三易馬
而三後
He changed his horses three times
but three times he lagged behind.
襄主曰
Lord Xiang then remarked:
子之教我御
術未盡也
"You have taught me how to drive
but the course is not yet complete."
對曰
Yuqi responded:
術已盡
用之則過也
"The course has finished,
but the fault lies in the way it is applied.
凡
御之所貴
馬體安於車
人心調於馬
Generally speaking,
what is important in driving
is to fix the bodies of the horse firmly to the carriage
and the mind of the driver to the horses.
而後可以進速致遠
Then you can drive fast and far.
今君
後
則欲逮臣
先
則恐逮於臣
Now, Your Highness,
whenever behind
wants to get ahead of your servant
and whenever ahead
is afraid of lagging behind your servant.
夫誘道爭遠
非先則後也
Inevitably when you run a race
you will be either ahead or behind others.
而先後
心皆在於臣
上何以調於馬
Whether ahead or behind
if Your Highness is fixated on your servant,
how can Your Highness keep the horses under control?
此君之所以後也
This was the reason why Your Highness lagged behind."

[^yu-lao-23]: Emending Wangzi Qi 王子期 to Wang Yuqi 王於期
(Chen Qiyou 2000: 7.21.454n.1).

白公勝
慮亂
罷朝倒杖
而策銳貫顊
Duke Sheng of Bo,
preoccupied with his plans of rebellion,
left the court and was standing alone
when he picked up a horsewhip upside down and pierced his chin.
血流至於地
而不知
Though his blood flowed all over the ground,
he was not conscious of it.
鄭人聞之曰
When a native of Zheng learned of this, he said:
顊之忘
將何為忘哉
"If one forgets one's chin,
what is there that one does not forget!"
故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 其出彌遠者
"*The farther one goes,*  
其智彌少
*the less one knows.*"

此言智周乎遠
則所遺在近也
This means that if your intelligence penetrates afar,
you will miss what is at hand.
是以聖人無常行也
能並智
This is why the sage has no definite destination,
but can know both far and near.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
不行而知
"*Know by not journeying.*"
{能並視}
故曰
Therefore it is said:
不見而明
"*Understand by not looking.*"

隨時
以舉事
Follow the seasons
to initiate your undertakings.
因資
而立功
Accord with the inherent qualities of things
to establish your achievements.
用萬物之能
而獲利其上
Employ the abilities of the myriad things
to obtain benefits for the ruler.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
不為而成
"*Accomplish by not doing.*"
