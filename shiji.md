# Appendix: _Shi chi_ Han Fei entry

The following is Han Fei's biography from
_The Grand Scribe's Records_,
Revised Volume VII, 2021,
William H. Nienhauser, Jr. Editor.

---

Han Fei 韓非 (d. 233 BC) was one of the Noble Scions of Han.
He enjoyed the study of "punishments and their designations"
and "techniques of legal models,"
but his essentials were rooted in [the teachings of] Huang-Lao.
Fei was a stutterer and could not recite his own advice,
but he was skilled at composing written works.[^shiji-34]
He and Li Ssu 李斯 (d. 208 BC)[^shiji-35]
both followed Minister Hsün 荀 (d. ca. 238 BC) as their teacher.
[Li] Ssu himself felt he was not the equal of [Han] Fei.

[^shiji-34]: Ch'ien Chung-shu 錢鐘書 (1910–1998),
_Kuan-tsui pien_ 管錐編 (Peking: Chung-hua, 1979), p. 310 ff.,
notes that there are many other famous writers
who are known to tradition as stutterers.

[^shiji-35]: See his biography in _Shih chi_
chapter 87 and Ch'ien Mu's "Li Ssu, Han Fei k'ao" 考 (Chu-tzu, pp. 477–79).

[Han] Fei saw the gradual waning of Han
and admonished the King of Han in letters several times,
but the King of Han could not use his advice.
Thus Han Fei came to loathe that in regulating the state
[the king] did not labor to improve and clarify its laws and institutions,
nor did he exercise his power to rein in his subjects,
and that in enriching the state and strengthening its forces,
when it came to seeking out men and employing the worthy,
he instead raised up frivolous, dissolute parasites
and placed them above those with merit and substance.
He felt that "Confucians use decorum to disorder the laws,
and knight-errants violate the prohibitions with their violence."[^shiji-36]
"When times are slack
they coddle men with high reputations
and when times are dire
they use knights with armor and helmets.
Those who are now cultivated
are not those whom the ruler uses
and those whom the ruler uses
are not those whom he cultivates."[^shiji-37]
He mourned for the upright who were not tolerated by wicked and perverse vassals
and observed the critical situations for success and failure in the past;
thus he wrote "Kufen" 孤憤 (Pent-up Emotions of a Solitary Man),
"Wu-tu" 五蠹 (Five Parasites),
"Neiwai ch'u" 內外儲 (The Inner and Outer Congeries),
"Shuo-lin" 說林 (The Forest of Advice),
and "Shuo-nan" 說難 (The Difficulty of Advice),
totaling over 100,000 characters.[^shiji-38]

[^shiji-36]: This is a quote from _Han Fei tzu_
(49.449, _Han Fei tzu chi-chieh_ 韓非子集解 (Peking Chung-hua, 1998).

[^shiji-37]: This is a reworking of _Han Fei tzu_
(49.450, _Han Fei tzu chi-chieh_):
"When the state is at peace,
[the ruler] cultivates scholars and knight-errants.
When troubles arrive,
he employs men of arms.
What is of benefit to him he does not use
and what is of use to him he does not treat as beneficial."

[^shiji-38]: "Pent-up Emotions of a Solitary Man"
reflected Han Fei's inability to be employed.
"Five Parasites"
referred to those men employed in his stead.
"The Inner and Outer Congeries" and "The Forest of Advice"
were collections of anecdotes.
"The Difficulty of Advising"
refers again to Han Fei's problems in impressing the King of Han.
"Shuo" could in all cases also be transcribed as "shui"
which then would mean "persuasion."

But although Han Fei knew the difficulty of advice
and described it quite thoroughly in his work, "The Difficulty of Advice,"
he died in Ch'in in the end,
and was unable to avoid this [difficulty] himself.
"The Difficulty of Advice" says,[^shiji-39]

[^shiji-39]: Han Fei's essay "The Difficulty of Advising"
also appears in the modern version of _Han Fei tzu_
(12.85–95, _Han Fei tzu chi-chieh_),
but there are substantial differences
between the _Shih chi_ and _Han Fei Tzu_ versions.
The _Shih chi_ version is shorter
and appears to have at least one lacuna, as noted below.
Because of the numerous differences between these two versions,
only the most important variations are pointed out in the notes which follow.
Other English translations of this essay include W. K. Liao,
_The Complete Works of Han Fei Tzu_
(London: Arthur Probsthain, 1959), pp. 106–112;
Burton Watson, _Han Fei Tzu: Basic Writings_
(New York: Columbia University Press, 1964), pp. 73–79;
and Arthur Waley, _Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China_
(London: Allen & Unwin, 1939), pp. 242–47.
Both Liao and Watson translate the _Han Fei Tzu_ version,
while Waley claims to have used both versions in his translation.

> What is difficult in advising
is not a difficulty with gaining the knowledge providing the means to advise,
nor is it a difficulty with the arguments illustrating my intent,[^shiji-40]
nor is it a difficulty in daring to exhaust my abilities without reserve.[^shiji-41]
What is difficult in advising is knowing the mind which I seek to advise,
and matching my advice to it.

[^shiji-40]: Omitting the word *nan* 難 in the _Shih chi_ text.

[^shiji-41]: Reading *heng-shih* 橫失 as *heng-yi* 橫佚.

> If the one being advised is motivated [by the desire] for a great reputation,
and you advise him concerning great profit,
you will appear to be unprincipled,
and to treat him as a base man.[^shiji-42]
You are then sure to be driven off.
If the one being advised is motivated [by the desire] for great profit
and you advise him concerning a great reputation,
you will appear unperceptive and out of touch with reality.
You are then certain not to be accepted.
If the one being advised actually seeks great wealth
while publicly seeking a great reputation
and you advise him concerning a great reputation,
then he will openly accept you while in fact ignoring you.
If you advise him concerning extravagant wealth,
then he will secretly follow your words
while publicly abandoning you.
These are matters one cannot but know.

[^shiji-42]: Reading *yü* 遇 as *ou* 偶.

> Tasks are accomplished through secrecy,
and counsel fails when it is revealed.
Although [the adviser] might not reveal it himself,
if [the adviser's] counsel touches on that which [the nobleman] seeks to conceal,
he is in danger.[^shiji-43]
If the nobleman has occasions on which he errs,
and the adviser openly offers good suggestions which highlight these errors,
the adviser is in danger.
If [the adviser] has not yet attained [the nobleman's] good graces,
and speaks with all his wisdom,
then if his advice is used and [the nobleman] is successful,
his merit will be lost;
if his advice is not used and [the nobleman] fails,
he will be doubted,
and again he is in danger.
If the nobleman obtains a plan and wishes to take credit for it himself,
if the adviser knows of this,
he is in danger.
If [the nobleman] openly proposes something when his intentions are on something else,
if the adviser knows of this,
he is in danger.[^shiji-44]
If [the adviser] would force something on him which he is certain not to do,
or if [the adviser] would stop him from something he cannot help but do,
[the adviser] is in danger.

[^shiji-43]: In this paragraph, the _Han Fei tzu_ text
lists seven ways in which the persuader can endanger himself (4:6b–7a, _SPPY_).
The _Shih chi_ text omits the third of these
and changes the order somewhat.
The wording is also frequently different.

[^shiji-44]: Reading the character *yeh* in the phrase 迺自以為也故
as either an error or loan for *t'a* 他.

> Thus it is said,
"If you speak to him of great men,
he will think you are criticizing him.
If you speak to him of humble men,
he will think you are selling positions."
If you speak of what he loves,
he will think you are manipulating him.
If you speak of what he hates,
he will think you are taunting him.
If you shorten your advice,
then he will think you ignorant and demote you.
If you are verbose in your writings,
then he will think they are too numerous and take too long to read.
If you follow his wishes in presenting your opinions,
he will say you are timid and remiss.
If you weigh matters broadly,
he will say you are uncouth and arrogant.
These are the difficulties of advising,
you cannot but know them.

> In general in advising the task
lies in knowing how to embellish
all that which the one being advised respects
and to speak bad of that which he despises.[^shiji-45]

[^shiji-45]: Instead of *ching* 敬 (to respect)
the _Han Fei tzu_ text (12:89, _Han Fei Tzu chi-chieh_)
reads *chin* 矜 "to be proud of,"
and instead of _Shih chi_'s *ch'ou* 醜
it reads *ch'ih* 恥 (to be ashamed of).
Following this sentence,
the _Shih chi_ version omits a section
in the _Han Fei Tzu_ text
describing how to ingratiate oneself with "the nobleman."

> If the advised himself invented his strategy,
then do not drive him into a corner with its shortcomings.[^shiji-46]
If he finds his own decision courageous
then do not anger him by advancing a counterpart.[^shiji-47]
If he exalts in his own strength
then do not attack him with difficulties.
If he commends other events which involved similar plans,
cited as exemplars other men who had similar actions,
then there will be no harm if you embellish [your own advice] with these.[^shiji-48]
If there are others who have made the same errors [as your ruler],
then openly defend them as without error.

[^shiji-46]: This paragraph follows the next
"Commend other events . . ." in the _Han Fei tzu_ version (4.7b, _SPPY_).
Its sentences are also not exactly in the order found here.

[^shiji-47]: The _Shih chi_ text reads *ti* 敵
which in many ancient texts means "counterpart or adversary of a ruler."
The _Han Fei tzu_ text reads *che* 謫 (4.8b, _SPPY_).
T'ao Hung-ch'ing 陶鴻慶
(quoted in Ch'en Ch'i-yu 陳奇猷,
_Han Fei tzu chi-shih_ 韓非子集釋,
[Taipei: Han-ching Wen-hua Shih-yeh Yu-hsien Kung-ssu, 1983], p. 232, n. 35)
notes that the Han-era dictionary _Fang-yen_ 方言
explains *che* 謫 as *kuo* 過 "error"
and suggests that the _Shih chi_ variant is a phonetic loan.
The text would then mean
"do not anger him with the mistakes inherent in the decision."

[^shiji-48]: Our translation simply follows the _Shih chi_ text as it stands.
The _Han Fei Tzu_ version (4:9a, _SPPY_) reads
"If there were others who shared his faults,
be sure to vigorously defend them as harmless.
If there were others who shared his failures,
be sure to clearly defend them as blameless."
有與同汙者，則必以大飾其無傷也. 有與同敗者，則必以明飾其無失也.
It seems possible that the phrase 有與同汙者
has simply dropped out of the _Shih chi_ text.

> Great loyalty does not offend,
elegant speech should not affront.
Only then can you extend your intellect and discrimination for him.
This is how you can be intimate without arousing suspicion,
and how you can know the difficulty of being exhaustive.

> Only after many days have passed,
after you have benefitted in all ways from [the nobleman's] good graces,
after you have planned deeply without being doubted
and argued without having been blamed,
only then can you openly lay out benefit and cost
in order to obtain the success [of your plan]
and only then can you directly point out right and wrong
in order to embellish yourself.
When you hold firm to these things,
that means success of your advising.

> Yi Yin 伊尹[^shiji-49] was a cook
and Pai-li Hsi 百里奚[^shiji-50] was a slave,
but still it was through [their occupations]
that they approached their masters.[^shiji-51]
Thus these two men were both sages,
and yet they were unable to avoid servitude
and to wade through their times being sullied to this extent.
This is not something capable men would be ashamed of.[^shiji-52]


[^shiji-49]: Yi Yin used his culinary skills to persuade King T'ang,
founder of the Shang,
to follow the Way of the King
(see _Shih chi_, 3.93ff, Grand Scribe's Records, 1.100.)

[^shiji-50]: See _Shih chi_, 5.186ff, _Grand Scribe's Records_, 1.182.

[^shiji-51]: This paragraph is longer in the _Han Fei tzu_ version (4.9a, _SPPY_)
and occurs before the preceding paragraph in _Shih chi_.

[^shiji-52]: The _Han Fei tzu_ text (4.9a, _SPPY_) reads,
"If one were to be made a cook or a slave
and through this could be listened to and shake the world,
this would not be something an able man would feel ashamed of."
今以吾（言）為宰虜而可以聽用而振世，此非能仕之所恥也.
We adopt *ch'ih* 恥 from _Han Fei tzu_
for _Shih chi_'s reading *she* 設.
The _Shih chi_ sentence could possibly mean:
"If even two sages such as these two men
could not avoid being sullied like this,
then this is not something someone who is able to take office could prevent."

> There was a wealthy man in Sung,
whose wall collapsed because of the rain.
His son said,
"If you do not rebuild it, there will be bandits."
An elder of his neighborhood also said this.
That evening, [the wealthy man] did indeed lose much of his property.
His family thought the man's son wise,
but harbored doubts about their neighborhood elder.

> In former times,
Duke Wu 武 of Cheng (r. 769–743 BC)
wanted to attack [the state of] Hu 胡,[^shiji-53]
so he gave his daughter [to the Hu ruler] in marriage.
Then he asked his assembled vassals,
"We wish to put our weapons to use.
Whom could we attack?"
Kuan Ch'i-ssu 關其思 said,
"We could attack Hu."
The duke then executed Kuan Ch'i-ssu.
"Hu is our brother state,
what do you mean by saying we should attack them?"
When the Hu ruler heard this,
he thought that Cheng was friendly towards him
and did not prepare against it.
The men of Cheng attacked the Hu unexpectedly and captured [their city].
These two advisers were both adequate in their wisdom,
but in the graver case one was punished,
while in the lighter case, one was doubted.
Wisdom is not difficult then,
but using it is difficult indeed.

[^shiji-53]: Located near modern Kuei-yang City 歸陽市
in northwestern Anhwei
(T'an Ch'i-hsiang, 1.45 and Ch'ien Mu, _T'i-ming k'ao_, 382–83).
This is not a reference to the non-Chinese tribes north of China.

> In former times,
Mi Tzu-hsia 彌子瑕[^shiji-54] was the beloved of the Lord of Wey.
The law of Wey was that whoever harnessed a carriage of the lord without
authorization could be punished as severelhy as by removal of the foot.
Mi Tzu's mother became sick after a while, however,
and when someone heard of this, he traveled overnight to tell him.
Mi Tzu by forging [an order],
harnessed a carriage of the lord, and set out.
The lord thought him an honorable man when he heard of this and said,
"How filial!
For the sake of his mother,
he risks the penalty of removal of a foot!"
He once traveled with the lord to an orchard.
Mi Tzu ate a peach and thought it sweet,
so he offered it to the lord without finishing it.
The lord said,
"How he loves me!
He forgets his own appetite and remembers mine!"
When Mi Tzu had lost his looks and [the lord's] affection had slackened,
he finally offended the lord.
The lord said,
"After all, this is the one who forged an order to harness my carriage
and another time fed me with his half-eaten peach."

[^shiji-54]: Mi Tzu-hsia is mentioned once
in the Chan-kuo ts'e (10.5b, _SPTK_).
There may be a connection to Meng-tzu 5A.8
where a Mi Tzu is mentioned as host of Confucius in Wey.

> Thus Mi Tzu's behavior did not change,
yet he was valued as worthy at first,
then condemned at last as a criminal.
This was an extreme case of a change which love and hate can undergo.
Thus when one is loved by the ruler,
then when one's wisdom is appropriate,
one gets even more intimate,
and when one is disliked by the ruler
then when the offense is appropriate,
one gets even more estranged.
Therefore, men who would admonish and advise
cannot but observe whether their ruler loves or hates them
and only then advise him.

> The dragon is the sort of creature which can be tamed and even ridden.
But underneath his chin he has scales that curl outward,
each a foot in diameter,
and if you tug him by one,
he will certainly kill you.
The rulers of men also have curling scales;
to advise him without tugging on one
is close to success.

Someone brought Han Fei's work to Ch'in.
When the King of Ch'in had seen the works
"Pent-up Emotions of a Solitary Man" and "Five Parasites,"
he said, "Alas, if We could only see this man and make his acquaintance,
We would not regret anymore that all men have to die."
Li Ssu said, "This something that Han Fei has written."
The King of Ch'in thus vigorously attacked Han.
The King of Han at first had not employed Fei,
but when things grew dire,
he at last sent Fei as an emissary to Ch'in.
The King of Ch'in was pleased with him,
but did not yet trust him enough to employ him.
Li Ssu and Yao Chia 姚賈[^shiji-55] attacked and slandered him,
saying "Han Fei is one of the Noble Scions of Han.
Your Majesty at present wishes to unify the [lands of the] feudal lords,
but that [Han] Fei will always be on Han's side, not on Ch'in's,
is due to human disposition.
If Your Majesty now does not employ him
but sends him back after having detained him here for a long time,
this is simply presenting trouble to yourself.
It would be better to punish him for breaking a law."
The king thought they were right
and handed Fei down to the officials to deal with him.
Li Ssu sent someone to give Fei poison,
allowing [Han Fei] to kill himself.
Han Fei wished to present his case,
but could not get an audience.
The King of Ch'in later regretted his decision
and sent someone to pardon him,
but Fei had already died.[^shiji-56]

[^shiji-55]: Yao Chia appears three times in _Chan-kuo ts'e_
(3.80a; 6.70a and 7.28a, _SPTK_),
twice as a minister of Ch'in and once working for the state of Chao.
The first of these stories
relates how Han Fei slandered Yao
after he successfully completed a mission for the King of Ch'in.
When the King of Ch'in summoned Yao Chia to answer Han Fei's allegations,
he defended himself so successfully that the king "employed" Yao
and "punished" [*chu* 誅] Han Fei.
If *chu* is read as "execute"
then this story contradicts the _Shih chi_ account of Han Fei's death.

[^shiji-56]: _Shih chi_, 6.232 states that Han Fei's mission to Ch'in and death
both took place in 233 BC.
_Shih chi_, 15.754 repeats this,
but _Shih chi_, 45.1878 gives the date of his mission and execution as 234 BC.

Shen Tzu and Han Tzu both composed books
which have been passed down to later generations,
and many scholars possess these.
I, however, am simply saddened that Han Tzu could write "The Difficulty of Advice,"
but could not extricate himself from his own plight.
