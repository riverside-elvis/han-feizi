## 喻老 Yu Lao 2 (_Laozi_ 54)

楚莊王既勝
狩於河雍
When King Zhuang of Chu [d. 591 BCE] was victorious in war,
he held a hunt at Heyang.
歸
而賞孫叔敖
Upon his return,
he rewarded [the Prime Minister,] Sunshu Ao.
孫叔敖請
漢間之地沙石之處
Sunshu Ao then requested that he be given
the sandy and stony land near the Han River.
楚邦之法
祿臣再世
而收地
唯孫叔敖獨在
According to the laws of the Chu state,
gifts to subjects are confiscated after two generations,
however the lands of Sunshu Ao
alone remained intact.
此不以其邦為收者
瘠也
The reason his land was not confiscated
was because it was barren.
故九世而祀不絕
Accordingly nine generations sacrificed without interruption.[^yu-lao-15]
故曰
Therefore when it says:

[^yu-lao-15]: For other versions of this anecdote concerning Sunshu Ao,
see Major et al. 2010: 723.

> 善建不拔
"*What is firmly established will not be uprooted;*  
善抱不脫
*What is firmly embraced will not slip away.*  
子孫以其祭祀世世不輟
*Your sons and grandsons consequently will sacrifice generation after generation without end,*"

孫叔敖之謂也
it refers to Sunshu Ao.
