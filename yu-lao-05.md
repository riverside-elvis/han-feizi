## 喻老 Yu Lao 5 (_Laozi_ 63)

> 有形之類
大必起於小
Among the category [of things] that has form,
what is significant invariably arises from what was insignificant.  
行久之物
族必起於少
Among things that endure,
what is abundant invariably arises from what was scarce.

故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 天下之難事
必作於易
"*The difficult undertakings in the world evolve from what is easy;*  
天下之大事
必作於細
*the great undertakings in the world evolve from what is small.*"

是以欲制物者
於其細也
This is why those who desire to control things
must attend to the "minute."

故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 圖難於其易也
"*Plan for the difficult while it is easy;*  
為大於其細也
*Act on the great while it is small.*"

> 千丈之隄
以螻蟻之穴潰
A dike ten thousand feet long
will crumble from the holes bored by tiny termites;  
百尺之室
以突隙之煙焚
a hall one hundred feet square
will burn to the ground from the stray sparks that leap through a chimney crack.

故曰
Thus it is said:

> 白圭之行隄也
塞其穴
"*Bai Gui[^yu-lao-19] traversed the dikes,
making sure to plug its holes*;  
丈人之慎火也
塗其隙
*old men are cautious of sparks,
making sure to plaster chimney cracks.*"

[^yu-lao-19]: Bai Gui,
a native of Wei where he possibly served as Prime Minister,
is mentioned in many early texts as an expert in water control:
for example, _Mencius_ 6B.10 and 6B.11.
He also appears in the _Lüshi chunqiu_ on several occasions
in anecdotes that associate him with the philosopher Hui Shi
(Knoblock and Riegel 2000: 13/4.2B,16/1.5, 18/6.4,18/7.1, 19/8.4, and 20/3.5).

是以
This is why

> 白圭無水難
Bai Gui never encountered hardships due to flooding;  
丈人無火患
old men never encounter disasters due to fire.

此皆慎易以避難
敬細以遠大者也
These are both cases of taking precautions against things when they are still easy
in order to avoid difficulties
and paying attention to things when they are still minute
in order to prevent them from becoming great.

扁鵲見蔡桓公
Bian Que [a famed physician] once had an audience with Duke Huan of Cai.[^yu-lao-20]
立有間
扁鵲曰
After standing around for some time,
Bian Que said:
君有疾在腠理
"My lord has a disease which lies in the pores of his skin.
不治
將恐深
If it is not treated,
I fear it will spread deeper [into the body]."

[^yu-lao-20]: The reference to Duke Huan of Cai
is problematic since his life and that of Bian Que
were separated by some two hundred years (Chen Qiyou 2000: 7.21.442n.11).

桓侯曰
寡人無
"I am not sick,"
replied Duke Huan.
扁鵲出
桓侯曰
Bian Que departed
and Duke Huan remarked:
醫之好治不病以為功
"Physicians love to take credit for curing people who are not sick!"

居十日
扁鵲復見曰
Ten days later,
Bian Que again had an audience and said:
君之病在肌膚
"My lord's disease has spread to the flesh and skin.
不治
將益深
If it is not treated,
it will spread still deeper."
桓侯不應
Duke Huan did not respond.
扁鵲出
Bian Que left.
桓侯又不悅
The Duke of Huan was displeased again.

居十日
扁鵲復見曰
Ten days later,
Bian Que had another audience with the duke and said:
君之病在腸胃
"My lord's disease has spread to the intestines and stomach.
不治
將益深
If it is not treated,
it will go still deeper."
桓侯又不應
Again Duke Huan did not respond.
扁鵲出
桓侯又不悅
Bian Que left
and once again Duke Huan was displeased.

居十日
扁鵲望桓侯
而還走
Ten days later,
gazing from afar at Duke Huan,
Bian Que retreated and ran away.
桓侯故使人問之
Consequently,
the duke sent someone to inquire about [his behavior].
扁鵲曰
Bian Que explained:
疾在腠理
湯熨之所及也
"When the disease lies in the pores,
it can be treated with hot poultices.
在肌膚
鍼石之所及也
When the disease lies in the flesh and skin
it can be treated with metal or stone needles.
在腸胃
火齊之所及也
When the disease lies in the intestines and stomach,
it can be treated with well-boiled medicines.
在骨髓
司命之所屬無奈何也
But when the disease lies in the marrow of the bones,
what can even the likes of the Commissioner of Life do about it?
今在骨髓
Presently the disease lies in the bone marrow.
臣是以無請也
For this reason your servant has no more advice to give."

居五日
桓公體痛
Five days later,
Duke Huan fell ill.
使人索扁鵲
已逃秦矣
He sent someone to look for Bian Que,
but he had already fled to the state of Qin.
桓侯遂死
Duke Huan subsequently died.

故良
醫之治病也
攻之於腠理
For this reason,
when treating diseases,
good physicians attack them when they are still in the pores of the skin.
此皆爭之於小者也
This means that they manage things when they are still inconsequential.
{夫事之禍福亦有腠理之地}

故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 聖人蚤從事焉
"*The sage begins to attend to things early on.*"
