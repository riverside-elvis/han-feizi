## 喻老 Yu Lao 4 (_Laozi_ 36)

勢重者
人君之淵也
Positional advantage (*shi*)
that is weighty is the ruler's the "abyss".
君人者
勢重於人臣之閒
To rule the people,
your positional advantage must be weightier than that which rests with your ministers.
失
則不可復得也
If you lose it,
you cannot regain it.

簡公失之於田成
晉公失之於六卿
而邦亡身死
When Duke Jian [of Qi, r. 484–481 BCE] lost [his positional advantage] to Tian Cheng
[the minister who usurped his throne]
and the Duke of Jin lost it to the Six Ministers,[^yu-lao-17]
their states were destroyed
and they suffered death.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
魚不可脫於深淵
"*Fish cannot be snatched from the deep abyss.*"

[^yu-lao-17]: This is a reference to the six clans
that controlled the state of Jin
after the reign of Duke Zhao of Jin:
Hán 韓, Zhao 趙, Wei 魏, Fan 范, Zhonghang 中行, and Zhi 智.
From then on, the dukes of Jin served as mere figureheads.

> 賞罰者
邦之利器也
Rewards and punishments
are the efficacious instruments of the state.  
在君
則制臣
If they rest with the ruler,
they control the ministers;  
在臣
則勝君
if they rest with the ministers,
they defeat the ruler.  
君見賞
臣則損之
以為德
If the ruler reveals his rewards,
the ministers will minimize them
so as to enhance their own reputation for kindness;  
君見罰
臣則益之
以為威
if the ruler reveals his punishments,
the ministers will exaggerate them
so as to enhance their own reputation for awe inspiring authority.  
人君見賞
而人臣用其勢
If the ruler reveals his rewards,
the ministers will make use of his strategic advantage;  
人君見罰
而人臣乘其威
if the ruler reveals his punishments,
the ministers will avail themselves of his awe inspiring authority.

故曰
Therefore it is said:
邦之利器
不可以示人
"*The efficacious instruments of state
cannot be revealed to others.*"

越王
入宦於吳
而觀之伐齊以弊吳
King [Goujian] of Yue [r. 496–465 BCE]
entered into servitude in [the state of] Wu
and showed its ruler how to attack Qi
so as to exhaust Wu.
吳兵既勝齊人於艾陵
張之於江濟
強之於黃池
Subsequently the troops of Wu vanquished Qi's men at Ailing;
stretched as far as the Jiang and Qi Rivers;
and showed their strength as far as Yellow Pool.
故可制於五湖
Thus the King of Yue was able to take control at Five Lakes [where he defeated Wu].
故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 將欲翕之
必固張之
"*If you wish to shrink it,
you must certainly stretch it*;  
將欲弱之
必固強之
*if you wish to weaken it,
you must certainly strengthen it.*"

晉獻公將欲襲虞
遺之以璧馬
When Duke Xian of Jin [r. 676–651 BCE] was about to attack Yu,
he offered a jade disk and a steed;
知伯將襲仇由
遺之以廣車
when Earl Zhi was about to attack the Qiu You,
he offered a grand chariot.[^yu-lao-18]

[^yu-lao-18]: Earl Zhi wished to attack the Qiuyou,
a non-Chinese tribe of northerners,
so he presented a grand bell that he transported in a large carriage.
The Qiuyou accepted the present.
In order to transport the massive bell back home on the carriage they built a road,
providing a clear route of attack for Earl Zhi
(Chen Qiyou 2000: 7.21.440n.9; see also Major et al. 2010: 260).

故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 將欲取之
必固與之
"*If you wish to take something from someone,
you must certainly give something to someone.*"

起事於無形
而要大功於天下
是謂微明
To initiate an undertaking in the formless realm
and to accomplish great things in the world
is called "subtle discernment."
處小弱
而重自卑
謂損弱勝強也
To remain insignificant and weak
and value humbling one's person
is called "the weak defeating the strong."
