## 解老 Jie Lao 2 (_Laozi_ 58)

人有禍
則心畏恐
If people encounter disasters,
their hearts become fearful and timid.
心畏恐
則行端直
If their hearts are fearful and timid,
their conduct becomes proper and upright.
行端直
則思慮熟
If their conduct is proper and upright,
their thoughts become cautious and mature.
思慮熟
則得事理
If their thoughts are cautious and mature,
they comprehend the ordering principles of affairs.
行端直
則無禍害
If their conduct is proper and upright,
they will avoid disasters and harms.
無禍害
則盡天年
If they avoid disasters and harms,
they will live out their natural lifespan.
得事理
則必成功
If they comprehend the ordering principles of affairs,
they will inevitably achieve success.
盡天年
則全而壽
If they live out their natural lifespan,
they will become whole and long-lived.
必成功
則富與貴
If they inevitably achieve success,
they will become wealthy and noble.
全壽富貴之謂福
To be whole, long-lived, wealthy and noble is called good fortune.
而福本於有禍
Yet good fortune is rooted in disaster.
故曰
Hence there is the statement:
禍兮福之所倚
"*It is upon disaster that good fortune rests.*"
以成其功也
This is how you achieve success.

人有福
則富貴至
If people encounter good fortune,
wealth and honor arrive.
富貴至
則衣食美
If wealth and honor arrive,
clothing and food will be the very best.
衣食美
則驕心生
If clothing and food are the very best,
an arrogant heart is born.
驕心生
則行邪僻
而動棄理
If an arrogant heart is born,
conduct becomes evil and prejudicial,
and actions abandon the ordering principles [of the Way].
行邪僻
則身死夭
If conduct becomes evil and prejudicial,
people will die prematurely.
動棄理
則無成功
If actions stray from the ordering principles [of the Way],
people will not achieve success.
夫內有死夭之難
而外無成功之名者
大禍也
If inwardly people encounter the travails of a premature death
and outwardly they are bereft of a reputation for achieving success,
it is a grave disaster.
而禍本生於有福
Yet this grave disaster is rooted in and born of good fortune.
故曰
Thus it is said:
福兮禍之所伏
"*It is beneath good fortune that disaster crouches.*"

夫緣道理以從事者
無不能成
For those who rely upon the ordering principles of the Way to administer affairs,
there is nothing they cannot achieve.
無不能成者
大能成天子之勢尊
而小易得卿相將軍之賞祿
For those for whom there is nothing they cannot achieve,
the greater among them can achieve the power and position of the Son of Heaven
while the lesser among them can easily attain the rewards and emoluments of a minister or a general.
夫棄道理
而忘舉動者
雖上有天子諸侯之勢尊
而下有猗頓陶朱
卜祝之富
猶失其民人
而亡其財資也
For those who abandon the ordering principles of the Way
and irresponsibly initiate various actions,
though the highest among them may enjoy the positional advantage and dignity of the Son of Heaven or of a regional lord,
and the lowest among them may enjoy the wealth of an Yi Dun and Tao Zhu,
what you divine and pray for,
they still will lose the support of their people
and waste their resources and wealth.
眾人之輕棄道理
而易忘舉動者
不知其禍福之深大
而道闊遠若是也
For the majority of people who scorn and abandon the ordering principles of the Way
and irresponsibly initiate various actions,
it is due to the fact that they do not understand that the depth and breadth of ill and good fortune
and the expansiveness and far reaching quality of the Way are like this.
故諭人曰
Thus it is said:
熟知其極
"*Who knows its limit?*"

人莫不欲富貴全壽
而未有能免於貧賤死夭之禍也
There is no one in the world who does not desire wealth, nobility, wholeness or longevity
and yet no one is able to avoid the disasters of poverty, low station, death or a premature end.
心欲富貴全壽
而今貧賤死夭
是不能至於其所欲至也
The heart desiring wealth, nobility, wholeness or longevity
and yet encountering poverty, low station, death or a premature end,
means that it is unable to achieve what it desires to achieve.
凡
失其所欲之路
而妄行者之謂迷
As a general rule,
those who stray from the path of what they desire
and act irresponsibly are said to be confused.
迷
則不能至於其所欲至矣
Being confused,
they will not be able to achieve what they desire to achieve.
今
眾人之不能至於其所欲至
Indeed,
ordinary people are unable to achieve what they desire to achieve.
故曰迷
Therefore there is the reference to "*confusion*."
眾人之所不能至於其所欲至也
自天地之剖判以至于今
That the majority of people are unable to achieve what they desire to achieve
has been so since the time when Heaven and Earth were cut and severed from one another[^jie-lao-rse-1] until the present.
故曰
Thus it is said:
人之迷也
其日故以久矣
"*Indeed, the people's confusion
has certainly persisted for a long time.*"

[^jie-lao-rse-1]: Viz. the beginning of time; see Major et al. 2010: 114–115.

所謂方者
The term "square" means

> 內外相應也
the internal and the external correspond to one another  
言行相稱也
and word and deed accord with one another.

所謂廉者
必生死之命也
輕恬資財也
The term "sharp" means
to invariably live or die according to your proper destiny
and scorn property and wealth.

所謂直者
義必公正
The term "upright" means
to feel duty bound that you must be public-minded and upright.
公心不偏黨也
A public-minded heart is not prejudicial.

所謂光者
The term "radiant" means

> 官爵尊貴
your office and rank are respected and honored;  
衣裘壯麗也
your garments and furs are handsome and beautiful.

今有道之士
Nowadays those scholars who possess the Way,

> 雖中外信順
不以誹謗窮墮
though internally and externally they are trustworthy and compliant,
they neither slander the defamed nor debase the fallen;  
雖死節輕財
不以侮罷羞貪
though determined to die to preserve their fidelity and scorn wealth,
they neither insult the weak nor shame the covetous;  
雖義端不黨
不以去邪罪私
though righteous and impartial,
they neither disregard the wicked nor accuse the selfish;  
雖勢尊衣美
不以夸賤欺貧
though their positional advantage is lofty and their garments are magnificent,
they neither brag to the lowly nor despise the destitute.

其故何也
Why is this so?
使失路者
而肯聽習
問知
即不成迷也
It is to ensure that those who have lost their way
but who are willing to listen to those who are well versed
and to inquire of those in the know,
will no longer be confused.
今眾人之所以欲成功
而反為敗者
生於不知道理
而不肯問知
而聽能
Now the reason why most people desire to achieve success
but instead encounter failure,
is born of the fact that they do not understand the Way and its ordering principles
and they are not willing to inquire of the knowledgeable
or listen to the capable.
眾人不肯問知聽能
而聖人強以其禍敗適之
則怨
Since most ordinary people are not willing to inquire of the knowledgeable or listen to the capable,
if sages insist upon reproaching them for their disasters and failures,
there is only resentment.
眾人多
而聖人寡
Ordinary people are numerous
while sages are few.
寡之不勝眾
數也
That the few cannot prevail upon the numerous
is a matter of numbers.
今
舉動而與天下之為讎
非全身長生之道也
Indeed,
to initiate actions that will make enemies of the world
is not the Way to keep your body whole or prolong your life.
{是以行軌節而舉之也}
故曰
Thus it is said:
方而不割
"*He is square but does not cut;*
廉而不劌
*he is sharp but does not stab;*
直而不肆
*he is upright but not unrestrained;*
光而不耀
*he is radiant but don't dazzle.*"
