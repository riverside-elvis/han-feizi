## 解老 Jie Lao 7 (_Laozi_ 1)
	
凡
理者
As a general rule,
ordering principles constitute the distinctions between

> 方圓
the square and the round;  
短長
the short and the long;  
麤靡
the coarse and the fine;  
堅脆之分也
and the strong and the weak.

故
理定
而後可得道也
Thus,
only after ordering principles have been determined,
can you apprehend the Way.
故
定理
Thus,
determinate principles include

> 有存亡
existence and extinction,  
有死生
life and death,  
有盛衰
and prosperity and decline.

夫物之一存一亡
乍死乍生
初盛而後衰者
不可謂常
Now things that first exist and then become extinct,
first live and then die,
or that first prosper and then decline
cannot be said to be eternal.
唯夫與天地之剖判也具生
至天地之消散也不死不衰者
謂常
Only that which is born with the severing and separation of Heaven and Earth
and will neither die nor decline until Heaven and Earth disperse and disappear
is called "eternal."
而常者
無攸易
無定理
無定理非在於常所
What is eternal
has neither a changing location
nor a definite principle,
and is not inherent in an eternal place.
是以不可道也
This is why the eternal cannot be spoken of.
聖人觀其玄虛
用其周行
The sage observes its mysterious emptiness
and makes use of its comprehensive course [of activity in the world].
強字之曰道
然而可論
Compelled to give it a name he calls it "The Way"
and only then was it possible to discuss it.
故曰
Thus it is said:
道之可道
非常道也
"*The Way that can be spoken of
is not the eternal Way.*"
