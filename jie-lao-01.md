# 解老 Jie Lao (Explicating Lao)

## 解老 Jia Lao 1 (_Laozi_ 38)

德者內也
"Potency" refers to what is internal.
得者外也
"To obtain" refers to what is external.
上德不德
言其神不淫於外也
"Superior potency is not obtained"
means that the spirit is not enticed by [things] external [to the self].
神不淫於外則身全
If the spirit is not enticed by [things] external [to the self],
the self will become whole.
身全之謂德
德者得身也
A person whose self is whole is called "potent"
as potency means obtaining the self.

凡德者
As a general rule, "potency"

> 以無為集
by having no purposive action [for things] collects;  
以無欲成
by having no desires [for things] matures;  
以不思安
by not thinking [of things] becomes settled;  
以不用固
and by not making use [of things] becomes secure.

為之欲之
則德無舍
If you act for the sake of it and desire it,
"potency" will have no place to lodge itself.
德無舍
則不全
If "potency" has no place to lodge itself,
it cannot become whole.
用之思之
則不固
If you make use of it and think of it,
it will not become secure.
不固
則無功
If it does not become secure,
it will have no accomplishments.
無功
則生於德
Having no accomplishments
is born of acquiring what is external.
德
則無德
If you acquire what is external,
you will lack "potency."
不德
則在有德
If you do not acquire what is external,
you will possess "potency."
故曰
Thus it is said:
上德不德
"*The person of superior potency does not acquire [what is external].*
是以有德
*This is why he possesses potency.*"

所以貴無為無思為虛者
謂其意無所制也
The reason why non-action and non-thinking are valued as a means to achieve emptiness
is to assure that there is nothing that fetters the mind.
夫無術者
故以無為無思為虛也
夫故以無為無思為虛者
其意常不忘虛
是制於為虛也
Now if you lack the requisite techniques (*shu*)
and deliberately make use of non-action and non-thinking to achieve emptiness,
in doing so,
your mind will constantly be absorbed by thoughts of achieving emptiness
and consequently you will become fettered by the thoughts of achieving emptiness.
虛者謂其意無所制也
Emptiness refers to the fact that nothing fetters the mind.
今制於為虛
是不虛也
Indeed, to be fettered by thoughts of achieving emptiness
surely is not emptiness!
虛者之無為也
Those who are empty are non-active;
不以無為為有常
they do not take non-action as something to constantly possess.
不以無為為有常
則虛
If you do not take non-action as something to constantly possess,
you will become empty.
虛
則德盛
If you are empty,
your potency will flourish.
德盛之謂上德
If your potency flourishes it is called "the superior potency."
故曰
Thus it is said:
上德無為而無不為也
"*The person of superior potency takes no deliberate action
and yet there is nothing that is not accomplished.*"

仁者謂其中心欣然愛人也
Humaneness is to happily love others from your inner heart.
其喜人之有福
而惡人之有禍也
It is to delight in others' good fortune
and to detest others' misfortune.
生心之所不能已也
非求其報也
By nature it is what the heart cannot repress
and it is not a matter of seeking recompense.
故曰
Thus it is said:
上仁為之
而無以為也
"*The person of superior humaneness takes action
but has no reason for acting.*"

義者
Righteousness is

> 君臣上下之事
the affairs between ruler and minister, superior and inferior;  
父子貴賤之差也
the hierarchy between father and son, noble and humble;  
知交朋友之接也
the connections between intimates and acquaintances, friends and peers;  
親疏內外之分也
and the distinction between the close and the distant, internal and external.

It pertains to the suitability of

> 臣事君宜
the minister serving his lord;  
下懷上宜
the inferior cherishing his superior;  
子事父宜
the son serving the father;  
賤敬貴宜
the humble serving the noble;  
知交友朋之相助也宜
intimates, acquaintances, friends and peers assisting one another;  
親者內而疏者外宜
the close being [treated as] internal and the distant being [treated as] external.

義者謂其宜也
"Righteousness" is the suitability of these things.
宜而為之
Being suitable you do such things.
故曰
Thus it is said:
上義為之
而有以為也
"*The person of superior righteousness takes action
and has a reason for acting.*"

禮者所以貌情也
Ritual is what gives expression to the emotions.
群義之文章也
It is the cultural expression of various instances of righteousness,

> 君臣父子之交也
the exchanges between ruler and minister, and father and son,  
貴賤賢不肖之所以別也
and the differences between noble and base, and worthy and unworthy.  
中心懷而不諭
故疾趨卑拜而明之
What the inner heart cherishes is not always communicated,
and so a slow or quick pace, a bow or courtesy, makes it manifest.  
實心愛而不知
故好言繁辭以信之
What the true heart loves is not always apparent,
and so doting words and effusive phrases, makes it believable.

禮者外節之所以諭內也
Ritual refers to the various external embellishments that communicate what is internal.
[Thus ritual is the means by which the emotions are expressed.]
故曰
Thus it is said:
禮以貌情也
"*Ritual is what gives expression to the emotions.*"

凡人之為外物動也
不知其為身之禮也
In general, people are stimulated by external things
and do not understand ritual as something that is rooted in the self.
眾人之為禮也
以尊他人也
Ordinary people practice ritual
to show their respect for others.
故時勸時衰
Therefore sometimes they are conscientious while sometimes they are lax.
君子之為禮
以為其身
The Gentleman practices ritual
for his own sake.
以為其身
故神之為上禮
Since he does so for his own sake,
consequently his spirit gives rise to superior propriety.
上禮神
而眾人貳
Thus a person of superior propriety is spirit-like,
whereas ordinary people waiver in their commitment.
故不能相應
Therefore they cannot respond to one another.
不能相應
故曰
Since they cannot respond to one another,
it is said:
上禮為之
而莫之應
"*The person of superior propriety takes action,
and no one responds to him.*"

眾人雖貳
聖人之復恭敬
盡手足之禮也不衰
Whereas ordinary people waiver in their commitment,
the sage redoubles his efforts to be reverent and respectful,
practicing to the utmost the rituals that bind him hand and foot without fail.
故曰
Thus it is said:
攘臂而仍之
"*He rolls up his sleeves and persists at it.*"

> 道有積
The Way has its accumulations,  
而德有功
Potency has its achievements.  
德者道之功
Potency is the achievements of the Way.

> 功有實
Achievements have their concrete expressions;  
而實有光
Concrete expressions have their radiance.  
仁者德之光
Humaneness is the radiance of Potency.

> 光有澤
Radiance has its saturating effect;  
而澤有事
Its saturating effect becomes manifest in affairs.  
義者仁之事也
Righteousness is the affairs of Humaneness.

> 事有禮
Affairs have their Ritual;  
而禮有文
Ritual has its cultural expressions.  
禮者義之文也
Ritual is the cultural expression of righteousness.

故曰
Thus it is said:
失道而後失德
"*Losing the Way, potency is lost;*
失德而後失仁
*losing potency, humaneness is lost;*
失仁而後失義
*losing humaneness, righteousness is lost;*
失義而後失禮
*losing righteousness, ritual is lost."*

> 禮為情貌者也
Ritual is what gives expression to the emotions;  
文為質飾者也
Culture is what adorns the inner substance.

夫君子
Now the Gentleman

> 取情而去貌
cleaves to the inner emotions and disregards outer expressions;  
好質而惡飾
cherishes the inner substance and disdains the outer adornment.

夫
Now

> 恃貌而論情者
其情惡也
Those who must rely on outer expressions to judge inner emotions,
will find that such emotions are detestable;  
須飾而論質者
其質衰也
Those who must rely on outer adornments to judge the inner substance,
will find the inner substance wanting.

何以論之
How should this be discussed?

> 和氏之璧
不飾以五采
The jade of Master He
was never adorned with the five colors;  
隋侯之珠
不飾以銀黃
the pearl of Marquis Sui
was never adorned with silver or gold.

其質至美
物不足以飾之
This is because their inner substance was so beautiful
that there was nothing in the world that could add to their beauty.
夫物之待飾而後行者
其質不美也
Now if objects must first be adorned before they are used,
it is because their inner essence lacks beauty.
是以父子之間其禮樸而不明
故曰禮薄也
This is why the ritual that abides between father and son is simple and not showy
and why there is a reference to "ritual being insubstantial."

凡
As a general rule,

> 物不並盛
There are things that do not flourish simultaneously.
陰陽是也
Yin and yang are like this.  
理相奪予
There are ordering principles that either take away or give to.
威德是也
Severity and beneficence are like this.

實厚者
貌薄
If the inner substance is substantial,
the outer appearance is insubstantial.
父子之禮是也
The ritual that abides between father and son is like this.
由是觀之
禮繁者
實心衰也
From these examples we observe that,
the more intricate the ritual,
the more decrepit the substance of the heart must be.
然
則為禮者
事通人之樸心者也
Nonetheless,
those who practice the rites
are those who strive to touch the simple hearts of the people.
眾人之為禮也
人應則輕歡
不應則責怨
When ordinary people practice the rites,
they are pleased if others respond
and displeased if they do not respond.
今為禮者
事通人之樸心
而資之以相責之分
Nowadays those who practice the rites,
striving to touch the simple hearts of the people,
provide them with a standard that causes the people to be divided by mutual criticisms.
能毋爭乎
How then is it possible to avoid contention?
有爭則亂
When there is contention there is disorder.
故曰
Thus it is said:
禮者忠信之薄也
而亂之首乎
"*Ritual is the wearing thin of loyalty and sincerity
and the beginning of disorder.*"

先物行
先理動
之謂前識
To anticipate the occurrence of events
and the workings of ordering principles
is called "*foreknowledge.*"
前識者無緣而忘意度也
Foreknowledge is groundless and reckless conjecture.
何以論之
How should this be discussed?
詹何坐
弟子侍
有牛鳴於門外
Zhan He was seated
and his disciples were serving him
when a cow mooed outside his gate.
弟子曰
A disciple commented:
是黑牛也而白題
"It is a black ox with a white forehead."
詹何曰
Zhan He responded:
然
是黑牛也
而白在其角
"Yes
it is a black ox
but the white is on its horn."
使人視之
果黑牛
而以布裹其角
He instructed someone to go and inspect the ox
who found the ox to be black
with a white cloth wrapped around its horn.
以詹子之術
嬰眾人之心
華焉殆矣
To rely upon Master Zhan's techniques
to hamper the people's minds
is to be as precarious as a flower.
故曰
Hence there is the expression:
道之華也
"The flower of the Way."

嘗試釋詹子之察
而使五尺之愚童子視之
Now supposing that we discarded the foresight of Master Zhan
and sent out a naive lad less than five feet tall to investigate the ox.
亦知其黑牛
而以布裹其角也
He would surely discover the ox to be black
with a white cloth wrapped around its horn.
故以詹子之察
苦心傷神
而後與五尺之愚童子同功
Thus, the foresight of Master Zhan
that distresses the mind and harms the spirit,
achieved the same thing as a naive lad less than five feet tall also achieved.
是以曰
Hence there is the saying:
愚之首也
"the beginning of folly."
故曰
Thus it is said:
前識者道之華也
而愚之首也
"*Foreknowledge is the flowery embellishment of the Way
and the beginning of folly.*"

所謂大丈夫者
謂其智之大也
The expression "*great man*"
refers to the greatness of his wisdom.
所謂處其厚不處其薄者
行情實
而去禮貌也
The expression "*dwells in what is substantial and not in what is insubstantial*"
refers to acting out of the inner substance of the emotions
and disregarding the outer appearances of ritual.
所謂處其實不處其華者
必緣理
不徑絕也
The expression "*dwells in the fruit and not in the flower*"
refers to inevitably finding the causes of things in ordering principles
and not guessing randomly.
所謂去彼取此者
去貌徑絕
而取緣理
好情實也
The expression "*rejects the one and appropriates the other*"
refers to disregarding the outer appearance of ritual and random guessing
and abiding by the causes of things in the ordering principles
and the inner substance of the emotions.
故曰
Thus it is said:
去彼取此
"*[He] rejects the one and appropriates in the other.*"
