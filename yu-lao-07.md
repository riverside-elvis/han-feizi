## 喻老 Yu Lao 7 (_Laozi_ 52 and 71)

昔者
紂為象箸
而箕子怖
Long ago,
when Zhòu crafted ivory chopsticks,
[his uncle] the Viscount of Ji grew alarmed.
以為象箸
必不加於土鉶
必將犀玉之杯
He considered the fact that ivory chopsticks
would not be used with earthen wares
but with cups made of jade or of rhinoceros horns.
象箸玉杯
必不羹菽藿
則必旄象豹胎
Ivory chop sticks and jade cups
would not go with the soup made of beans and coarse greens
but with the meat of long-haired buffaloes and unborn leopards.
旄象豹胎
必不衣短褐
而食於茅屋之下
則錦衣九重
廣室高臺
Those who eat meat of long-haired buffaloes and unborn leopards
would not wear short hemp clothes
and eat in a thatched house
but would put on nine layers of embroidered dresses
and move to live in magnificent mansions and on lofty terraces.
[Therefore he said:]
吾畏其卒
故怖其始
"I fear how this will end,
therefore I tremble at what has begun."

居五年
紂為肉圃
設炮烙
登糟邱
臨酒池
In the space of 5 years,
Zhòu made gardens of flesh,
set up the roasting pillar,
walked upon mounds of distiller's grains,
and gazed over pools of wine.
紂遂以亡
Zhòu consequently met his demise.
故
箕子見象箸
以知天下之禍
Thus,
by beholding the ivory chop sticks
the Viscount of Ji predicted the impending catastrophe that was to engulf the empire.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
見小曰明
"*Seeing what is small is called insight.*"

句踐入宦於吳
身執干戈
為吳王洗馬
When Goujian entered into servitude in Wu,
he personally wielded shield and spear
and acted as the king's forward scout
[literally the one who went ahead of the horse and chariot of the king].[^yu-lao-21]
故能殺夫差於姑蘇
Thus [subsequently] he was able to kill [King] Fuchai [of Wu] at Gusu.
文王見詈於王門
顏色不變
而武王擒紂於牧野
Likewise,
when King Wu \[of Zhou][^yu-lao-22] was disgraced at Jade Gate,
his facial expression did not change
and so [subsequently] King Wu took Zhòu prisoner at Muye.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
守柔曰強
"*Abiding in softness is called strength.*"

[^yu-lao-21]: Reading *xianma* 洗馬 as *xianma* 先馬 (Chen Qiyou 2000: 7.21.448n.2).

[^yu-lao-22]: Emending Wen 文 to Wu 武 (Chen Qiyou 2000: 7.21.448n.4).

> 越王之霸也
不病宦
The hegemony of the King of Yue
was due to not looking upon surrender as a flaw;  
武王之王也
不病詈
The kingship of King Wu
was due to not looking upon disgrace as a flaw.

故曰
Therefore it is said:
聖人之不病也
以其不病
"*The sage's not being flawed
is because he does not treat things as flawed*.
是以無病也
*This is why he is flawless.*"
