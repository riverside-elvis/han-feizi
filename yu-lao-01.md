## 喻老 Yu Lao 1 (_Laozi_ 46)

天下有道
無急患
則曰靜
遽傳不用
When the world has the Way,
there are no anxieties or worries
and so it is tranquil
and couriers are not employed.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
卻走馬以糞
"*One relegates swift horses to fertilize [the fields].*"
天下無道
攻擊不休
相守數年不已
甲冑生蟣蝨
鷰雀處帷幄
而兵不歸
When the world is without the Way,
attacks and battles do not end
and mutual defense persists several years without ceasing,
until the troops do not return home
though their armor and helmets teem with lice and gnats,
though swallows and sparrows nest in their curtains and tents.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
戎馬生於郊
"*Warhorses breed in the suburbs.*"

翟人有獻豐狐
玄豹之皮於晉文公
A man from Di presented fox furs with thin haired tails
and leopard fur with black spots to Duke Wen of Jin [r. 636–628 BCE].
文公受客皮而歎曰
此以皮之美自為罪
Duke Wen accepted the gifts but heaved a sigh and said:
"These [animals] brought retribution on themselves due to the beauty of their hides."
夫治國者以名號為罪
徐偃王是也
Now rulers who brought on their own retribution due to their reputations,
such a one was King Yan of Xu.[^yu-lao-12]
以城與地為罪
虞虢是也
Those who brought on their own retribution due to their cities and territories,
such were [the rulers of] Yu and Guo.[^yu-lao-13]
故曰
Therefore it is said:
罪莫大於可欲
"*There is no transgression greater than having something that can be coveted.*"

[^yu-lao-12]: King Yan of Xu was a non-Chinese ruler of a southern people
whose dates are unclear (see Chen Qiyou 2000: 19.49.1093n.4).
For the story of King Yan of Xu's reputation for practicing humaneness and rightness,
see Major et al. 2010: 747–48.

[^yu-lao-13]: The Duke of Yu and the Duke of Guo lost their territories
to Duke Xian of Jin (r. 676–651 BCE)
as a consequence of being enticed by gifts presented by Duke Xian of Jin.
The _Huainanzi_ explains the circumstances under which the rulers of Yu and Guo
lost their territories to Jin.
See Major et al. 2010: 726.

智伯兼范中行
而攻趙不已
Earl Zhi [d. 453 BCE] annexed the territories of Fan and Zhonghang
and attacked Zhao without cease.
韓魏反之
軍敗晉陽
身死高梁之東
Hán and Wei rebelled against Earl Zhi.
His troops suffered defeat at Jinyang
and he met his death to the east of Gaoliang.
遂卒被分
漆其首以為溲器
In the end [his territory] was divided up
and his skull was lacquered and made into a drinking vessel.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
禍莫大於不知足
"*There is no misfortune greater than not knowing contentment.*"

虞君欲屈產之乘
與垂棘之璧
The Lord of Yu coveted Quchan's steed
and Chuiji's jade disk.
不聽宮之奇
故邦亡身死
He did not heed Gong Zhiqi
and so his state was ruined and he met his death.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
咎莫憯於欲得
"*There is no disaster more sorrowful than desiring to obtain things.*"

> 邦以存為常
霸王
其可也
A state takes surviving as the norm,
whether hegemon or king,
it is permissible.  
身以生為常
富貴
其可也
A person takes living as the norm,
whether wealthy or noble,
it is permissible.[^yu-lao-14]

[^yu-lao-14]: Note that _Huainanzi_ 14.46
preserves a somewhat different version of this saying:
"Thus a state considers remaining intact as the norm,
becoming hegemon or king as the extraordinary exception.
A person considers life as the norm,
becoming wealthy or noble as the extraordinary exception.
Only those who will not injure their kingdom for the sake of the world
or harm themselves for the sake of a kingdom
can be entrusted with the world" (Major et al. 2010: 575).

不欲自害
則邦不亡身不死
If you do not allow your desires to cause you harm,
then the state will not be lost
and you will not suffer death.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
知足之為足矣
"*To know contentment is to be content.*"
