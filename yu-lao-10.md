## 喻老 Yu Lao 10 (_Laozi_ 41)

楚莊王蒞政三年
無令發
無政為也
King Zhuang of Chu had been overseeing his administration for 3 years
but he neither issued any decrees
nor implemented any policies.
右司馬御座
而與王隱曰
One day when the Commander of the Right was accompanying the king in his carriage,
he spoke the following veiled words to him:
有鳥止南方之阜
三年不翅
不飛
不鳴
"There is a bird which has taken up a perch on a hillock to the south.
For 3 years it has not beaten its wings,
taken flight,
or cried out in song.
嘿然無聲
It is silent and without sound.
此為何名
How can this be called a 'bird'?"
王曰
The king replied:
三年不翅
將以長羽翼
"For 3 years it has not taken flight
for it wishes to allow for the growth of its feathers and wings.
不飛不鳴
將以觀民則
It has not taken flight or cried out in song
for it wishes to observe the tendencies of the people.
雖無飛
飛必沖天
Although it has not taken flight,
when it does, it will certainly penetrate the heavens.
雖無鳴
鳴必驚人
Although it has not cried out in song,
when it does, it will certainly amaze everyone.
子釋之
Let it go.
不穀知之矣
I understand your message."

處半年
乃自聽政
所廢者十
所起者九
Within half a year,
the king personally attended to his administration
whereupon he abolished ten policies
and established nine;
誅大臣五
舉處士六
而邦大治
punished five chief officials
and promoted six scholars
so that the state became greatly ordered.
舉兵誅齊
敗之徐州
Meanwhile, he dispatched troops to attack the state of Qi
and won victory at Xuzhou.
勝晉於河雍
合諸侯於宋
遂霸天下
莊王不為小害善
故有大名
He then defeated the state of Jin at Heyong
and called together the lords of the land at Song,
subsequently establishing his hegemony over the world.
King Zhuang never accomplished good deeds in a small way
and so established a great reputation;
不蚤見示
故有大功
he did not reveal his intentions prematurely
and so accomplished great things.
故曰
Therefore it is said:

> 大器晚成
"*The great vessel takes long to reach completion;*  
大音希聲
*the great note rarely sounds.*"
